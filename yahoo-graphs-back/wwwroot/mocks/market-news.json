        "content": "<p>It's the seasonal adage investors love to debate: \"Sell in May, go away.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But in a market currently driven by policy headlines, many strategists say this year's climate doesn't fit the usual patterns. With lingering economic uncertainty, fragile technicals, and geopolitical catalysts like US-China trade talks in play, few see a clear case for stepping to the sidelines — at least not just because the calendar says so.</p> \n<p>\"We're in a different market this year,\" Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, told Yahoo Finance last week. \"Historically, if we go back over the past ten years, sell in May hasn't actually worked too well.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The saying traces its roots overseas to when London traders timed their market exits in the summer before buying again just after the famous Saint Leger horse race in September. The idea was to skip the typically sluggish summer months and reenter when markets historically perform better.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This approach proved effective during the early days of modern Wall Street between 1960 and 1987.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But things shifted after <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042115/what-caused-black-monday-stock-market-crash-1987.asp\">the major market crash of 1987. </a>Following that, a fully invested strategy began to outperform, and staying invested through the summer months became more favorable. Since then, holding steady during this period has generally been a winning strategy, at least on balance.</p> \n<div id=\"a476c81072014c70bee507f906120c08\"></div> \n<p>According to data compiled by LPL Financial, the S&amp;P 500 (<a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC\">^GSPC</a>) has historically posted its weakest average returns between May and October — just 1.8% since 1950 — compared to the stronger November-to-April period.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While summer returns have been positive 65% of the time, their relative underperformance has reinforced the \"sell in May\" trend as seasonal market behavior. However, not everyone is convinced the pattern holds in today's volatile market.</p> \n<p>\"Seasonality data can provide important insights into the potential market climate, but it doesn't represent the current weather,\" Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. \"And when it comes to markets, tariff uncertainty and monetary policy right now have the power to make it rain or part clouds into sunshine.\"</p> \n<p>\n <core-stock-ticker class=\"ticker-chart\" id=\"839b01d061274b9b9f7120a7c251eb83\" data-range=\"1mo\" data-symbol=\"^GSPC\" data-comparisons=\"^IXIC,^DJI\" data-exchange=\"SNP\" /></p> \n<p>From a technical standpoint, stocks showed significant progress in April but remained in recovery mode after all three major indexes posted their <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-come-back-from-steep-lows-after-gdp-print-to-cap-turbulent-april-200112050.html\">worst monthly performances of the year.</a></p> \n<p>\"This is a very high volatility news driven cycle,\" Tentarelli added. \"I'm looking to buy the pullbacks as opposed to sell the rallies.\"</p> \n<p>Markets have been whipsawed by President Trump's tariff rollout <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-china-says-door-is-open-to-trade-talks-with-the-us-191201877.html\">as ongoing back-and-forth trade developments</a> with other countries continue to muddy the outlook.</p> \n<p><em>Read more: </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-the-latest-news-as-the-president-seeks-to-reshape-us-trade-policy-191201706.html\"><em>The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs</em></a></p> \n<p>\"Just because ['sell in May'] has some statistical significance doesn't mean it always works, right?\" Siebert Financial chief investment officer Mark Malloch said. \"In a situation where we've had markets move up and down quite a bit, it's questionable on whether that can be a factor.\"</p> \n<p>Plaza Advisory Group wealth manager Andrew Briggs agreed, noting, \"We have had a nice recovery in April, which is great to see.

While concerns of a possible recession are mounting, government data on Friday showed a strong 177,000 jump in April payrolls.</p>\n<p>If the Fed indeed declines to cut rates, Powell, who was appointed by Trump in 2018, could face even more pressure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Trump said in the interview taped Friday that Powell doesn’t want to cut rates “because he’s not a fan of mine. You know, he just doesn’t like me because I think he’s a total stiff.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Senior aides, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have privately urged Trump to soothe jittery markets by making clear he’s not planning to remove Powell, Bloomberg has reported. In mid-April, Trump set off fears by saying in a social media post that “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” followed by Oval Office remarks to reporters that “if I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me.”</p>\n<p>Trump also defended his mass deportations of undocumented migrants and complained about judicial rulings requiring the administration to give immigrants due process before deporting them.</p>\n<p>Asked if he needs to uphold the Constitution, Trump said, “I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>He added, “I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.”</p>\n<p>Trump also defended his tariff policy, saying that companies are starting to move production facilities to the US.

However, you’re entitled to full benefits only when you reach your full retirement age, or FRA. For example, if you turn 62 in 2025, your benefit would be roughly 30% lower than it would be at your full retirement age of 67.</p> \n<p>If you delay benefits from your FRA until age 70, you earn delayed retirement credits. Those come to roughly an 8% increase for each year until you hit 70, when the credits stop accruing.</p> \n<p>Most people, however, claim earlier, according to the SSA data. Nearly 30% of new Social Security beneficiaries claim benefits at age 62. Around 32% claim benefits after age 62 but before their FRA.</p> \n<p><em>Read more: </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/retirement-age-154633920.html\"><em>What is the retirement age for Social Security, 401(k), and IRA withdrawals?</em></a></p> \n<p>There is no escaping the fear — real or not — people have of potentially losing their benefits.</p> \n<p>“We are hearing anecdotally that more people are claiming Social Security benefits earlier than they had planned because they are concerned Donald Trump and Elon Musk are taking that away,” Nancy Altman, the president of Social Security Works, a group that advocates against cuts to the program, told Yahoo Finance.</p> \n<p>“This is very unfortunate because it is best to delay claiming as long as possible if you can, so that you get larger monthly checks for the rest of your life.”</p> \n<div id=\"47e2949e88c747f79b999898c3b81fec\"> \n</div> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-a-primary-source-of-retirement-income\"><strong>A 'primary source' of retirement income</strong></h2> \n<p>It’s a decision most folks sweat over.</p> \n<p>About 3 in 5 workers and more than 4 in 5 retirees have thought about how the age at which they claim Social Security can impact the amount they receive, according to a new<a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ebri.org/retirement/retirement-confidence-survey\"> report </a>from the nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI).</p> \n<p>Social Security being reduced or ceasing to exist in the future tops the list of retirees’ greatest retirement fears, according to a recent Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies report.</p> \n<p>They aren’t wrong to worry, even without the DOGE cuts.</p> \n<p>The 2024 Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report predicts that the combined retirement and disability trust fund reserves will go broke in 2035.

It's just not that simple. Tariffs are hurting a lot of companies (including Apple (<a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL\">AAPL</a>) to the tune of $900 million in extra costs, we learned this week). But it's not hurting others, as conventional wisdom would hold.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Put it all together, and you have a very confusing investing backdrop.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The best thing I can do is present what the world's top leaders are seeing and hearing. From there, you make your own judgment on where the economy may be headed — because, honestly, I'm not sure, and I suspect that confusion will be on display in my chats this week at Milken.</p> \n<p>Here's what CEOs have told me in the last week on Trump tariffs, markets, and the US economy.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-coca-cola-ko-chairman--ceo-james-quincey\">Coca-Cola (<a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO\">KO</a>) chairman &amp; CEO James Quincey</h3> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-full-interview\"><a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-ceo-we-are-holding-prices-for-now-despite-the-trade-war-160354197.html\">Full interview</a></h3> \n<p>\"If you look at the US business, the weakness in volume in Q1 was concentrated in what we call future consumption packaging, which is much more predominant in supermarkets or ... independent trade outlets, rather than either convenience or the away-from-home quick-serve restaurants and all the away-from-home channels. So that's where the weakness was focused, which I think is partly an indication of some of the affordability pressure for the lower-income consumer and some of the geopolitical reaction.\"</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-starbucks-sbux-chairman--ceo-brian-niccol\">Starbucks (<a data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SBUX\">SBUX</a>) chairman &amp; CEO Brian Niccol</h3> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-full-interview\"><a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/starbucks-ceo-turnaround-consumers-third-135354950.html\">Full interview</a></h3> \n<p>\"If you look at our results, what I'm seeing actually is a step up in transactions as it relates to our business in the US.

        "content": "<p>CVS Health (<a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.finance.yahoo.com/quote/CVS\">CVS</a>) is one of the largest healthcare companies in the country, boasting a vertically integrated business that raked in more than $124 billion in revenues last year.</p> \n<p>But not all parts of its business are equal. The front-end of its CVS retail pharmacies — the brand it is best known for — has been struggling for years, just like its peers in the sector. The pharmacy benefit manager Caremark is the target of political pressure. The Aetna insurance plans have had mixed success over the years. And questions remain about CVS's ability to succeed in the health provider space with its 2023 acquisition of Oak Street.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After former CEO Karen Lynch left late last year and the company began a strategic review to potentially break up certain units, new CEO David Joyner is faced with answering the question: What, exactly, is CVS?</p> \n<p>Is it a retail pharmacy giant, an insurance giant, or does it continue to be, like UnitedHealth Group, an awkward mix of vertically integrated parts that, thanks to government rules and regulations, can never totally sync their operations?</p> \n<p>\"We are, as a management team, working through that very question,\" Joyner told Yahoo Finance in an interview this week.</p> \n<p>But it doesn't appear the company is ready to shed any of its parts, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/cvs-explores-options-including-potential-break-up-sources-say-2024-09-30/\">as had been reported</a> late last year.</p> \n<p>\"I would say that the overarching theme is, I want to become America's most trusted healthcare company. And to do that, I do think we have to be in both the provider business, which is in the pharmacy and in the clinic business, and I also think we need to be able to manage the risk, which is part of what Aetna and Caremark brings to the table,\" Joyner said.</p> \n<p>\"I would expect, by the year-end, we will have a much better and more organized story to tell,\" he added.</p> \n<div id=\"279c065ef68d40e49a5853a5cb79d41d\"></div> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-glp-1-move\">The GLP-1 move</h2> \n<p>One major move the company made this week was to address the high cost of popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.</p> \n<p>CVS chose Novo Nordisk's (<a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVO\">NVO</a>) Wegovy as the preferred drug on its formulary and excluded Eli Lilly's (<a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.finance.yahoo.com/quote/LLY\">LLY</a>) Zepbound on the list. In response, Eli Lilly's CEO told Yahoo Finance he wasn't interested in exclusive deals and that he felt confident in the access points the company has created, including the online prescription options connected through LillyDirect.</p> \n<p>In fact, CEO David Ricks said, the new prescriptions being filled for vials rather than injectables from LillyDirect equaled more than the total of new prescriptions for Wegovy.</p> \n<p>\"I think we've really found an interesting part of the market here,\" Ricks said, adding that he hopes there will eventually be more insurance coverage for weight-loss drugs.</p> \n<p>When asked about that idea, Joyner told Yahoo Finance he agrees there is a case to be made for online platforms when insurance doesn't cover the products.</p> \n<p>\"I do agree with what Dave Ricks has said. I do think that in those hair-loss products, ED [erectile dysfunction] products, all these other categories which generally are not covered by plan sponsors, there ... are multiple ways to access it,\" Joyner said.</p> \n<p>His own experience, though, informs Joyner after three decades that customers value in-person store experiences.</p> \n<p>\"While it has always been a cost-effective distribution point, it has not been the preference of the consumer and even during COVID, [when] people were not leaving their homes, we should have seen this massive spike in home delivery. We still didn't get anywhere near what the optimal rates were,\" Joyner said.</p> \n<p>Joyner added that over time, it's possible that digital and home delivery numbers grow.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-abandoning-the-aca\">Abandoning the ACA</h2> \n<p>CVS also announced this week it was leaving the Affordable Care Act marketplace, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/01/aetna-abandon-affordable-care-act-health-insurance-marketplaces-cvs-health/\">for the second time.</a></p> \n<p>Joyner said its Aetna insurance plans are unprofitable and not worth the trouble. If they did decide to reenter the exchange, most states mandate a five-year waiting period.</p> \n<p>\"So, this is why this has been ... such an important decision for us, about whether or not we could actually find our way to profitability before five years, or should we exit. So that tells you the calculus that we were looking at in terms of this market,\" Joyner said.</p> \n<p>He added that there is likely to be more volatility in the ACA space as questions swirl around the future of government-funded enhanced subsidies, which are <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.kff.org/interactive/how-much-more-would-people-pay-in-premiums-if-the-acas-enhanced-subsidies-expired/#:~:text=First%20enacted%20in%202021%20under,$2%2C033%20($24%2C392%20per%20year).\">set to expire at the end of this year</a>, barring new legislation, and how that impacts the rate of plan sign-ups in coming years.</p> \n<p><em>Read more: </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/what-is-a-health-savings-account-140052424.html\"><em>What is a health savings account (HSA)?</em></a></p> \n<p>\"I think the ACA business is a viable product as long as it's funded and supported by the government. I do think it's a business that ... can work. Unfortunately, the way we built our product and the way that our network was put together, and the way in which — we're just small, we're subscale, and we have not prioritized that segment of our business,\" Joyner said.</p> \n<p>The company has been caught in what Joyner termed a \"bad underwriting cycle\" with a confluence of factors that include the ways in which marketplace plans are sold, how brokers are paid, and other companies' exits that resulted in \"a really bad mix in the markets that we are serving.\"</p> \n<p>Because it's a government-subsidized product, it doesn't follow data cycles the way normal insurance products do, giving the company insight and predictability for certain markets.</p> \n<p>Joyner said the company is intently focused on its strategic turnaround and felt like the marketplace just wasn't a priority.</p> \n<p>\"It's not an indictment on the product (or) the market. It's basically our inability to effectively compete,\" he said.</p> \n<p>\"I just didn't think I had enough time, and enough money, quite frankly, to get us to a path to where ... it worked for us.\"</p> \n<a href=\"https://stockstory.org/high-quality/top-6-to-buy-this-week?partner=yahoo&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=top6\">\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/17752130-4b4a-11ef-bff9-fd72468bde0c\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/17752130-4b4a-11ef-bff9-fd72468bde0c\" style=\"height:275px;width:700px;\" alt=\"StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\" data-uuid=\"98ce93b5-76d4-3e7d-afcd-84c13bb8dd69\">\n  <figcaption>\n   StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n  </figcaption>\n </figure></a> \n<p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/anjalee-khemlani/\"><em>Anjalee Khemlani</em></a><em> is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

The new city commission will have authority over zoning, building projects and more pedestrian aspects of life.</p> \n<p>Over the past seven years, SpaceX has reshaped the area known as Boca Chica, transforming the once sleepy retirement community into a thriving production site for the development of SpaceX’s powerful Starship rocket, the vehicle by which Musk hopes to execute his long-standing dream to start a human settlement on Mars.</p> \n<p>But SpaceX officials say the company has been unable to provide enough housing for the hundreds of workers who want to live near its headquarters. A recent attempt to build more townhouses was rejected by the county. About 260 SpaceX employees live in the enclave on the southern tip of Texas; their partners and families push the total population close to 500. An additional 3,100 workers commute from Brownsville, the closest big city, or other locales.</p> \n<p>The town looks in some places like the set of a science-fiction movie, complete with futuristic manufacturing facilities, tidy rows of near-identical houses and a massive bronze bust of Musk.</p> \n<p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/made-in-usa-wheelbarrows-promoted-by-trump-are-now-made-in-china?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Made-in-USA Wheelbarrows Promoted by Trump Are Now Made in China</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-02/how-an-israeli-hostage-negotiator-outsmarts-ransomware-hackers?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">How an Israeli Hostage Negotiator Outsmarts Ransomware Hackers</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-01/100-wild-moments-from-trump-s-first-100-days-you-probably-missed?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">100 Moments You Might Have Missed From Trump’s First 100 Days</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-01/can-the-labubu-doll-craze-survive-trump-s-tariffs?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Can the Labubu Doll Craze Survive Trump’s Tariffs?</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/healthy-sodas-like-poppi-olipop-are-drawing-pepsi-and-coca-cola-s-attention?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Healthy Sodas Like Poppi, Olipop Are Drawing PepsiCo’s and Coca-Cola’s Attention</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>©2025 Bloomberg L.P.</p>",

At the annual meeting in Omaha, Buffett said he expects that to occur by a unanimous vote.</p> \n<p>Abel will step forward to take responsibility for all of Berkshire’s eclectic assortment of businesses with their nearly 400,000 employees and the conglomerate’s massive stock portfolio.

Whereas Buffett grew Berkshire over the decades by making well-timed deals and stock investments at attractive prices, Berkshire’s massive size has made it that much harder lately to find anything big enough to change the conglomerate’s bottom line.</p> \n<p>Abel has big shoes to fill, but no one expects him to match the accomplishments of Buffett that made him a billionaire many times over and one of the wealthiest investors of the past century.

He is a strategic thinker.\"</p> \n<p>Buffett has said for years that Abel’s main job when he becomes CEO will be to preserve Berkshire’s unique decentralized culture built on independence, integrity and trust. In fact, Munger’s comment that gave away Abel’s future role was that “Greg will keep the culture.”</p> \n<p>Executives at a diverse mix of Berkshire subsidiaries, including sneaker maker Brooks Running, flooring giant Shaw and Borsheims jewelry have said they all turn to Abel whenever they face tough questions in their businesses related to strategy or operating details, and he’s always available when they need him though he will challenge them.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r036y6CXXNJl804J5nRMpQ--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap_finance_articles_694/6e46ad462c02936b0a17c0db3bca04c5\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap_finance_articles_694/6e46ad462c02936b0a17c0db3bca04c5\" style=\"height:3495px;width:5243px;\" alt=\"FILE - Berkshire Hathaway shareholders line up to take selfies with Greg Abel Friday, May 3, 2024, in Omaha, Neb.

And, you know, Warren has that intuition, but Greg has a lot of it as well.\"</p> \n<p>Abel has never done many interviews, though he put his detailed business knowledge on display at the Berkshire meetings when discussing utilities and the railroad. But he did offer a glimpse into <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://horatioalger.org/members/detail/gregory-e-abel/\">his background</a> to the Horatio Alger Association when that group honored him in 2018.</p> \n<p>Abel's family-oriented upbringing in Edmonton, Alberta, and lessons in hard work and perseverance were similar to what Buffett learned while working in his grandfather’s Omaha grocery store as a kid.</p> \n<p>“I think hard work leads to good outcomes. In my schooling, in sports, and in my business positions, I learned that if I put in a lot of work and was well-prepared, then success would be more likely,” Abel said in 2018.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Abel lives about two hours from Buffett’s hometown in Des Moines, Iowa, where he has led Berkshire Hathaway Energy since 2011 and helped coach his kids’ hockey and soccer teams. He is expected to continue living there because Berkshire is so decentralized that there is little reason to move to its Omaha headquarters. Buffett only had a couple dozen people working in his office as he spent his days reading business reports and making the occasional phone call.</p>",

Meaning $10,000 invested in Berkshire in 1965 is now worth over $500 million.</p> \n<div id=\"c0eaebf119864c40a0888c5ae106f78a\">\n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Buffett after the long standing ovation he received after announcing his exit as CEO: <br><br>\" The enthusiasm shown by that response can be interpreted in two ways, but I'll take it\" <a href=\"https://t.co/LanKvGyKAX\">pic.twitter.com/LanKvGyKAX</a><br><br></p>— The Transcript (@TheTranscript_) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheTranscript_/status/1918733355522101455?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 3, 2025</a>\n </blockquote> \n</div> \n<p>Called \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" the weekend's main event kicked off with the legendary investor <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LWBphTImy4\">taking questions from CNBC's Becky Quick</a> and Berkshire shareholders.</p> \n<p><em>Check out the updates below for full coverage.</em></p> \n<p>Buffett, Greg Abel, and Ajit Jain took questions for a little over two hours; just Abel joined Buffett for a final two-hour stretch that wrapped up around 2:00 p.m. ET.

Temu – and other Chinese e-commerce sites like Shein and AliExpress – had previously used the de minimis exemption, as it was known, to flood the US with ultra-low-price goods. And while US President Donald Trump says that he wants his new tariffs to help bring manufacturing back to the US, the move by Temu shows how major companies could evade that demand and try other tactics.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P0FCH8S945e5C01C.kS2MA--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_business_articles_218/47132787fb221fae2fbe226a8d5210db\" alt=\"Employees produce garments for the online Chinese e-commerce company Temu at a clothing factory in Guangzhou in southern China's Guangdong province on April 16. - Jade Gao/AFP?Getty Images\" data-uuid=\"5fafd3e3-0935-3efe-9e5e-97ed18986441\">\n <figcaption>\n  Employees produce garments for the online Chinese e-commerce company Temu at a clothing factory in Guangzhou in southern China's Guangdong province on April 16. - Jade Gao/AFP?Getty Images\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>The de minimis loophole allowed shipments of goods worth $800 or less to come into the United States duty-free, often skipping time-consuming inspections and paperwork. Chinese e-commerce sites arguably took the most advantage of the exemption, flooding the US market with ultra-low-cost products. But with Trump imposing punishing tariffs on all Chinese imports, the millions of Americans who became reliant on those sites could find those cheap goods less affordable.</p> \n<p>The vast majority of Shein and Temu products are manufactured in China and imported directly to the US, which is why the prices are so cheap.</p> \n<p>Temu’s new business lingo may sound like it’s right up Trump’s alley. But just because a product is shipping to customers from a “local warehouse” doesn’t mean it’s made in the USA.</p> \n<p>Sites like Temu and Shein have been building up their US warehouse portfolio for years to lower shipping times.

When those items run out, it’s unclear if they will stay sold out for US consumers, or if new items will be subject to the tariffs Trump has placed on China.</p> \n<p>For now, that means foreign-made products are arriving on Americans’ doorsteps through US distributors. Temu does not publicly list its manufacturer partners.</p> \n<p>Tang said on Friday that if there are shortages, Temu has few options.

But fears of a slowdown are mounting, and President Donald Trump and some of his deputies keep hammering the central bank for an interest-rate cut.</p>\n<p>Caught in that bind, Fed Chair Jerome Powell may have been comforted by government data on Friday showing a healthy 177,000 jump in April payrolls. As long as the labor market holds firm, the Fed can more easily justify standing pat.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Fed’s favored inflation gauge showed price pressures continued to slowly ease. While Powell &amp; Co. would typically welcome such a cooling, higher US duties on imports risk upending the progress they’ve made on inflation.</p>\n<p>Indeed, uncertainty is the dominant factor now for major central banks around the world. The White House is pursuing deals on the tariff front that could once again shift the landscape, a nightmare for anyone trying to forecast future economic conditions.</p>\n<p>What Bloomberg Economics Says:</p>\n<p>“We expect Powell to push back against market pricing and signal a renewed priority on price stability. Officials like Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and Fed Governor Adriana Kugler have voiced concerns that inflation expectations may be loosening. Add to that the solid April payroll print and there’s little pressure for a near-term cut.”</p>\n<p>— Anna Wong, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger, Estelle Ou and Chris G. Collins, economists. For full analysis, click here</p>\n<p>The European Central Bank has continued to cut rates in anticipation of continued disinflation and weaker growth caused by US tariffs. But euro-area inflation unexpectedly held steady in a report released on Friday, while an underlying measure jumped.</p>\n<p>Another illustration of the fog of the trade war: The Bank of Canada in April abandoned its usual practice of releasing a base-case forecast. Instead, it issued two potential — and very different — scenarios that hinge on how Canada’s tariff dispute with the US turns out.</p>\n<p>The US economic data calendar is light in the coming week. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management issues its April services index. Economists will then focus on jobless claims data for any signs layoffs are becoming more pronounced. Initial applications in the week ended April 26 jumped to the highest since February, largely due to a spring recess-related surge in New York filings.</p>\n<ul>\n <li>For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for the US</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Canada, newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney is set to meet Trump within the week, and will also start assembling a cabinet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jobs data may show continued weakness, merchandise trade numbers for March will reflect tariffs, and the Bank of Canada’s financial stability report will offer insight into the capacity of businesses and households to weather a potential recession.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, several monetary decisions are scheduled, with rate cuts anticipated in the UK and Poland, a hike in Brazil, and no change in Sweden and Norway.</p>\n<p>Click here for what happened in the past week, and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy.</p>\n<p>Asia</p>\n<p>The region will see data on factory or services activity from a number of countries, including China, Japan, Singapore and India, providing early insight into the impact of Trump’s tariffs.</p>\n<p>The week kicks off with Pakistan’s rate decision as tensions with neighboring India escalate.</p>\n<p>On the same day, Singapore publishes retail sales for March, while figures from Indonesia will likely show the economy there contracted in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>The following day, China publishes the Caixin activity report for April at a time when measures across Asia are showing a sudden worsening because of Trump’s trade war. Vietnam has a flurry of data on tap, from inflation to trade and retail sales, while Australia — where elections on Saturday saw the incumbent center-left Labor Party returned to power with an increased majority — reports building approvals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, New Zealand and the Philippines will publish employment reports, while data from Thailand will show consumer prices likely eased further in April.</p>\n<p>Malaysia’s central bank is set to leave interest rates unchanged on Thursday at 3%, while first-quarter data will likely show the Philippines economy maintained its momentum in the new year.</p>\n<p>On Friday, all eyes will be on China’s trade data for April, the first month since US “Liberation Day” tariffs were imposed and Beijing retaliated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another key set of data comes from Japan, where investors will focus on real wages after they fell for a second straight month in February. South Korea reports its balance of payments, while Indonesia has consumer confidence data. Finally, investors will keenly watch China’s inflation data on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong are bringing forward dividend payments to the second quarter, a move that may smooth out yuan volatility over the year.</p>\n<ul>\n <li>For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for Asia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Europe, Middle East, Africa</p>\n<p>The Bank of England is widely expected to cut borrowing costs on Thursday. Armed with forecasts that take account of Trump’s tariff onslaught, officials will probably ease despite price pressures that have kept inflation noticeably above 2%.</p>\n<p>Investors will then parse Governor Andrew Bailey’s remarks, with observers currently anticipating UK policymakers stay on a slow but steady pace of one rate cut per quarter.</p>\n<p>Nordic central bank decisions the same day may show officials in a wait-and-see mode:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Sweden’s Riksbank is widely expected to keep its rate at 2.25% for a second meeting. Inflation has stayed elevated even as a growth indicator showed likely stagnation in the first quarter. With economists cutting back forecasts for expansion, expectations are building for a quarter-point rate cut later this year.</li>\n <li>In Norway, central bankers are also anticipated to refrain from a rate move, in line with their March projection for just two cuts this year, most likely starting in September. Governor Ida Wolden Bache has said that not all of a recent inflation pickup looks temporary. The nation has little direct trade exposure to the US, but officials worry about the knock-on effects of a global tariff war.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monetary announcements are scheduled across Eastern Europe:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Poland’s central bank is poised to lower borrowing costs on Wednesday for the first time in 19 months. That follows a shock pivot toward easing from Governor Adam Glapinski that may deliver a rate cut less than two weeks before the nation’s May 18 presidential election.</li>\n <li>The following day in Prague, Czech policymakers could enact their final cut for the cycle. Czech National Bank Deputy Governor Eva Zamrazilova raised that prospect in an interview on Monday, and Governor Ales Michl struck a similar tone.</li>\n <li>A Serbian decision is scheduled for Thursday after officials kept borrowing costs unchanged for a seventh month in April after sticky inflation and months of political protests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>African decisions are also on the calendar:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>On Wednesday, Mauritius is set to leave its key rate at 4.5% to contain price pressures amid uncertainty over US tariffs.</li>\n <li>A day later, Uganda’s central bank will likely cut borrowing costs. Inflation remains below its 5% target and the shilling has been largely steady since mid-April.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monetary policy will be a focus of the Reykjavík Economic Conference at the end of the week. The BOE’s Bailey and several other central bankers from the US to China and South Africa will be there.</p>\n<p>The ECB Governing Council holds its annual retreat in Porto, Portugal, on Tuesday and Wednesday, with the central bank’s strategy review on the agenda.</p>\n<p>In euro-zone data, industrial numbers may draw attention, with production data due from France, Germany and Spain, along with German factory orders.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Swiss data on Monday could show inflation at a four-year low, and central bank chief Martin Schlegel speaks the following day. Consumer-price numbers are also due from Sweden, Norway and Hungary.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Turkey releases April inflation on Monday. A steady annual outcome of 38% is expected, although monthly price growth is likely to have increased after the arrest of Istanbul’s mayor led to a sharp depreciation in the lira against the dollar.</p>\n<ul>\n <li>For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for EMEA</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Latin America</p>\n<p>Market readouts are on tap from Argentina’s central bank, Citi’s local unit in Mexico, and Brazil’s central bank, with its weekly Focus survey of economists.</p>\n<p>The good news for Banco Central do Brasil ahead of its May 6-7 meeting is that inflation expectations appear to be finally leveling off.</p>\n<p>The bad news is they’re still running at alarmingly elevated levels. Analysts see BCB plumping for a half-point rate increase, to 14.75%, on Wednesday. On Friday, the early consensus has April consumer price data showing a move up from the prior month’s 5.48%.</p>\n<p>Peru’s central bank, unlike Brazil’s, doesn’t have an inflation issue, and its economy isn’t in need of stimulus. The consensus has chief Julio Velarde and colleagues holding at 4.75% for a fourth meeting.</p>\n<p>Colombia’s central bank, meanwhile, offers up its quarterly monetary policy report on Monday, featuring updated forecasts and scenario analyses.</p>\n<p>BanRep on Tuesday posts the minutes of its April 30 meeting, where officials delivered a surprise quarter-point cut, to 9.25%. The median estimate of economists surveyed by the central bank see another 250 basis points of easing this year and next.</p>\n<p>In addition to Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Chile will publish April consumer prices reports.</p>\n<p>Chile and Colombia may see moderate disinflation, while Brazil and Mexico are likely to see consumer prices ticking higher — in Mexico’s case, breaching the 4% top of the central bank’s target range.</p>\n<ul>\n <li>For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for Latin America</li>\n</ul>\n<p>--With assistance from Swati Pandey, Vince Golle, Beril Akman, Laura Dhillon Kane, Monique Vanek, Mark Evans, Ott Ummelas, Philip Aldrick and Robert Jameson.</p>\n<p>(Updates with China’s early dividend payouts in Asia section)</p>\n<p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/made-in-usa-wheelbarrows-promoted-by-trump-are-now-made-in-china?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Made-in-USA Wheelbarrows Promoted by Trump Are Now Made in China</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-02/how-an-israeli-hostage-negotiator-outsmarts-ransomware-hackers?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">How an Israeli Hostage Negotiator Outsmarts Ransomware Hackers</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-01/100-wild-moments-from-trump-s-first-100-days-you-probably-missed?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">100 Moments You Might Have Missed&nbsp;From Trump’s First 100 Days</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-01/can-the-labubu-doll-craze-survive-trump-s-tariffs?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Can the Labubu Doll Craze Survive Trump’s Tariffs?</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/healthy-sodas-like-poppi-olipop-are-drawing-pepsi-and-coca-cola-s-attention?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Healthy Sodas Like Poppi, Olipop Are Drawing PepsiCo’s and Coca-Cola’s Attention</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>©2025 Bloomberg L.P.</p>",

        "content": "<p>By Olesya Astakhova and Ahmad Ghaddar </p> \n<p> LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) -OPEC+ plans to further accelerate oil output hikes and could unwind its 2.2 million barrels per day of voluntary cuts by the end of October if members do not improve compliance with their production quotas, five sources from the group said. </p> \n<p> OPEC+ shocked the oil market in April by agreeing a faster-than-expected unwinding of cuts despite weak prices and demand. The move was designed by OPEC+ leader Saudi Arabia to punish some members for poor quota compliance, sources have said. </p> \n<p> The group, which includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, agreed another big output hike for June on Saturday, taking the total it plans to release in April, May and June to nearly 1 million bpd. </p> \n<p> OPEC+ will maintain the trend and will likely agree in June to release another 411,000 bpd in July, the five OPEC+ sources briefed on the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity. </p> \n<p> During Saturday's meeting, Saudi Arabia warned others against any non-compliance, one of the sources said, adding that a desire by some members to raise output was also a factor behind the decision to increase production as well as compliance issues. </p> \n<p> OPEC, the Saudi government's communications office, and the office of Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak did not immediately reply to a request for comment. </p> \n<p> The group will likely approve accelerated hikes for August, September and October, with the idea of unwinding the remainder of a big portion of voluntary cuts if Iraq, Kazakhstan and other laggards do not improve compliance and deliver compensation cuts, the sources said. </p> \n<p> If compliance does not improve, the voluntary cuts will be unwound by November, one of the sources said, referring to the 2.2 million bpd portion of OPEC+'s voluntary cuts by eight members. </p> \n<p> OPEC+ is still cutting output by almost 5 million bpd and many of the cuts are due to remain in place until the end of 2026. These cuts were agreed in various stages since 2022 to support the market. </p> \n<p> In December, OPEC+ agreed to gradually phase out the 2.2 million bpd voluntary part of total cuts by the end of September of 2026 but agreed to accelerate this process in April. </p> \n<p> Oil prices fell to a four-year low in April below $60 per barrel on accelerated OPEC+ hikes and as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs raised concerns about a global slowdown. </p> \n<p> \"The market will take this news negatively, as long as crude exports do not suggest an improved compliance within OPEC+,\" UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. </p> \n<p> Reuters reported this week that Saudi officials have briefed allies and industry officials that they are unwilling to prop up oil markets with further supply cuts. </p> \n<p> Kazakhstan defied OPEC+ this month when its energy minister said he will prioritise national interests over those of the OPEC+ group when deciding on oil production levels. Kazakhstan's April oil output exceeded its OPEC+ quota despite a 3% fall. </p> \n<p> (Additional reporting by Alex Lawler, Maha El Dahan, Yousef Saba and Dmitry Zhdannikov;Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov and Alex LawlerEditing by Frances Kerry and Helen Popper) </p>",

        "content": "<p>(Reuters) -Warren Buffett, 94, announced on Saturday he will step down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of 2025, and hand over the reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel. Here are reactions: </p> \n<p> Brian Moynihan, CEO at Bank of America: \"Warren Buffett has achieved unparalleled success over a seven-decade-plus career. Beyond his business success, his unprecedented philanthropic giving continues to be an example to follow. His life lessons delivered to young and old are as valuable as his business acumen. I have personally learned so much from him and look forward to continuing to benefit from his insights. He has been a tremendous supporter and investor in Bank of America and our nation's economy and the innovative spirit of the United States.\" </p> \n<p> JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co CEO Jamie Dimon: \"Warren Buffett represents everything that is good about American capitalism and America itself -- investing in the growth of our nation and its businesses with integrity, optimism, and common sense. I've learned so much from him to this very day, and I am honored to call him a friend.\" </p> \n<p> Apple CEO Tim Cook: \"There's never been someone like Warren, and countless people, myself included, have been inspired by his wisdom. It’s been one of the great privileges of my life to know him. And there’s no question that Warren is leaving Berkshire in great hands with Greg.\" </p> \n<p> Art Hogan, strategist at B. Riley Wealth: \"What a wonderful track record he’s had, one of the best we'll ever see. But it kind of makes sense for him to leave the arena now. I think he's built up a strong team that are already playing a greater role in decision making. And stepping back now leaves Greg Abel with a lot of cash to move forward with.\" </p> \n<p> Sierra Club Staff Attorney Rose Monahan: \"During Greg Abel’s reign, Berkshire Hathaway Energy has operated the dirtiest fleet of coal plants in the country, and that’s a fact. There is no indication that Berkshire Hathaway wants to be a climate leader, and Abel's appointment is Exhibit A. While Berkshire Hathaway executives and shareholders rake in billions in profit every year, the rest of us are paying the price for their climate inaction.\" </p> \n<p> Nate Garrison, chief investment officer, World Investment Advisors, Washington, Iowa: \"Everyone knew it was coming, they just didn’t know when. I think this has been well-telegraphed that Greg Abel would be the successor, so I don’t think it’s anything too shocking. With Charlie Munger now passed away, maybe Warren thought it was time to pass the torch to a new generation. It’s one of the largest companies in America; I don’t have any concerns about Berkshire Hathaway in the near or intermediate future; Buffett has built such an amazing machine -- heck, they own 5% of the Treasury bill market! It's something that will stand the test of time.\" </p> \n<p> Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital: \"I’m not alarmed by the news. We wouldn't be recommending to any of our clients to sell or lighten up their Berkshire holdings. I think that Berkshire has been trying to telegraph a transition for a while, I think the portfolio is in good hands with Abel. The moves they’ve made over the last year or so, cutting Apple stake in half and raising some cash, put it in a good place.\" </p> \n<p> (Reporting by David Shepardson, Suzanne McGee and Saeed Azhar; Editing by Edmund Klamann) </p>",

Popularised in the late 1970s, it once offered the best way to gain access to wines in high demand before they rose in price.</p> \n<p>But less interest in fine wine among the younger generation of wealthy investors and declining alcohol consumption have all hit demand. Consultancy Bain says that 65 per cent of drinkers in the top 10 consumer markets are moderating their alcohol intake.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In April, two of the best-known producers, Lafite Rothschild and Angélus, both released their priciest 2024 red wines at 31 per cent discounts to 2023’s vintage. Lafite’s is priced at €288 per bottle wholesale while Angélus’s is €180. Both are the lowest prices since 2014.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Many in the industry are now questioning the viability of the system in <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/b27b78f2-eb82-3de3-b402-79d746cdc426\">Bordeaux</a>.</p> \n<p>“If en primeur offers value then it is a valid sales model,” said Ella Lister at consultants Wine Lister. “But it’s just that [recently] en primeur has not done so.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23768d19-66fc-4252-9dd9-14f64ee82bbe\">Prices have fallen sharply</a> in recent years. An index of the 10 most recent vintages of five top Bordeaux producers compiled by wine exchange Liv-ex has declined almost 27 per cent in sterling terms in the two years to March.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With so much matured wine now available at similar or lower prices, many wealthy collectors have shied away from the 2024 vintage that has been offered en primeur since last month. Last year’s en primeur sales for the better-rated 2023 vintage also struggled.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“The major theme is that most investors [in Bordeaux wine] no longer need to buy and hold [en primeur] for the long term, given the stocks of back vintages available,” said Chloe Ashton, of 1275 Fine Wine in Switzerland, a merchant and adviser to wealthy collectors.</p> \n<p>“High-end claret buyers everywhere have drastically reduced their volumes,” she added.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bordeaux is also facing increased competition from other wine-growing regions. Both Burgundy in France and other countries such as Italy and the US have grabbed market share. In 2014, Bordeaux accounted for well over half of the trade in fine wine, according to Liv-ex. Last year, that proportion had dropped to about a quarter.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Last year’s poor harvest, as the region’s climate changes, did not help.</p> \n<p>“It’s a really tough time to sell these wines. This is not an unmissable vintage,” said wine critic Jane Anson.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Merchants hoping for a positive reaction from buyers to the lower prices have so far been disappointed.</p> \n<p>“It’s very challenging now, the most I’ve ever known,” said Miles Davis, fine wine consultant at merchant Vinum Fine Wines. “The worst [market] in at least 20 years.”</p> \n<p>Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2023</p> \n<p>© 2023 The Financial Times Ltd.

The BCDC operates under the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nber.org/\">National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)</a> and comprises a group of prominent economists.

It shapes the interpretation of economic cycles, informs the evaluation of policy decisions, and influences which lessons are carried into future downturns.</p> \n<p><em>Read more: </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/recession-proof-savings-181158511.html\"><em>7 ways to recession-proof your savings</em></a></p> \n<p>According to the NBER website, a recession is a \"significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.\"</p> \n<p>To make that call, the NBER looks at several key indicators: employment, real personal income, industrial production, and real business sales. It also weighs three main criteria — depth, diffusion, and duration — when assessing a downturn.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A particularly sharp drop in just one area can sometimes tip the scales, as it did during <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-us-economy-officially-exited-the-recession-in-april-2020-174103503.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall\">the COVID-induced recession of 2020</a>, when a severe and widespread collapse in activity led the committee to declare a recession that lasted only two months.</p> \n<p>\"It's not just two down quarters of GDP,\" Darda said. \"That's a common misconception of what a recession is.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<div id=\"bc8fa6990f3a4c18a50cb3a844ebf1ed\"></div> \n<p>Darda cited the 2020 recession as an \"unusual\" outlier. \"It only lasted two months, but the drop was so steep and broad-based that it met the threshold,\" he explained. \"The unemployment rate shot up from 3.5% to 15% in essentially two months. It was the shortest recession in history but also the deepest. Even during the Great Depression we didn't fall that much in any particular month.\"</p> \n<p>On the flip side, 2022 was an example of how relying on GDP alone can be misleading<a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-most-widely-anticipated-recession-in-history-never-came-155724207.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall\">.</a> \"We had two down quarters of GDP and a down stock market,\" Darda said. \"So, everybody thought, 'We're in a recession.' But as it turns out, there was no recession. One of those down GDP quarters was later revised slightly positive.\"</p> \n<p>Also in 2022, unemployment fell while job growth remained positive: \"Right out of the gate, that tells you there's something wrong with calling a recession,\" he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-data-can-get-very-noisy\"><strong>'Data can get very noisy'</strong></h2> \n<p>For a single indicator, Darda said<a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-us-economy-may-have-avoided-a-recession-so-far-heres-how-that-could-change-080021943.html\"> the unemployment rate</a> may be the most useful. In every recession on record, unemployment has risen by at least 200 basis points. Still, he emphasized that no single metric is definitive. Rather, it's the broader weight and totality of the data that truly matters.</p> \n<p>It's an important nuance as consensus views can easily become unanchored, especially following sharp stock market declines. Take 2022, for example: Fears of a looming recession surged<a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-most-widely-anticipated-recession-in-history-never-came-155724207.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall\"> </a>largely in response to the stock market's volatile performance, with the S&amp;P 500 (<a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC\">^GSPC</a>) dropping 25% between January and October.</p> \n<p>\n <core-stock-ticker class=\"ticker-chart\" id=\"4d7c10989efe4c8b90751f4c3bd9e54a\" data-range=\"max\" data-symbol=\"^GSPC\" data-comparisons=\"^IXIC,^DJI\" data-exchange=\"SNP\" /></p> \n<p>While the stock market is often viewed as a forward-looking indicator, history shows that not every downturn in equities signals an economic recession. Notable declines in 1987, 2011, and late 2018 all occurred without a subsequent recession.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That's why the NBER does not consider stock market performance in its determinations. It also avoids softer survey-based indicators such as <a data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-confidence-plunges-for-fifth-straight-month-as-jobs-inflation-fears-rise-on-trump-trade-policy-144559015.html\">consumer confidence</a>, which recently reflected rising inflation expectations and a more pessimistic labor outlook amid trade-related uncertainties.</p> \n<p><em>Read more: </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/mortgages/article/how-to-recession-proof-your-house-181524031.html\"><em>How to recession-proof your house</em></a></p> \n<p>\"In periods of disruption, the data can get very noisy,\" Claudia Sahm, former Federal Reserve board economist and chief economist at New Century Advisors, told Yahoo Finance.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>She pointed to the<a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-contracts-at-03-rate-in-q1-first-gdp-pullback-in-3-years-123544859.html\"> most recent negative GDP reading</a> as an example, noting, \"In all likelihood, GDP is going to snap back in the second quarter because when we look under the hood, it was this front-running of the tariffs to increase imports and spending ahead of time. That demand was borrowed from the future.\"</p> \n<p>That's why the NBER prefers to wait before making the official call. But for businesses and policymakers, delaying action until after the fact isn't realistic. Monitoring a broad set of real-time indicators can help cut through the noise and guide more timely decisions.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-05/bbceb0a0-2774-11f0-bfff-1a60c629acec\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-05/bbceb0a0-2774-11f0-bfff-1a60c629acec\" style=\"height:2848px;width:4288px;\" alt=\"Recession fears are rising, but economists caution an official downturn may not be declared for months — or even years.

The rule was <a data-i13n=\"cpos:16;pos:1\" href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME\">briefly triggered</a> in 2022 (<a data-i13n=\"cpos:17;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/july-jobs-report-unemployment-rate-jumps-to-43-job-gains-total-just-114000-as-labor-slowdown-deepens-190219766.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall\">and again in 2024</a>), reflecting a modest rise in unemployment, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:18;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-most-widely-anticipated-recession-in-history-never-came-155724207.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall\">but no recession followed</a> — highlighting both its usefulness as an early warning tool and its limitations amid unusual economic conditions.</p> \n<p>Sahm cautioned that recessions are hard to predict and are often driven by unexpected shocks.

Manufacturing is smaller, services dominate, and that makes typical business cycle signals harder to read. \"We've said the odds of recession are elevated but less than 50%,\" he said. \"If it's a more marginal case — [an economy] bouncing around zero— it's going to be a lot harder to call a recession in real time.\"</p> \n<p>We'll find out for sure when the NBER umpires make the call.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:23;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/alexandra-canal/\"><em>Alexandra Canal</em></a><em> is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

This figure is important because it provides a clear snapshot of your overall financial health. Tracking your net worth helps you determine whether you're building wealth or accumulating debt over time.</p> \n<p>According to the Federal Reserve’s <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf23.pdf\">2022 Survey of Consumer Finances</a> (the most recent survey available), the median net worth for all families in the United States is $192,300. The mean (or average) net worth is $1.06 million.</p> \n<p>Several factors can impact your net worth, including where you live. Curious how your net worth compares to the rest of the country?

That’s why it’s helpful to look at the median, which refers to the middle number in a sorted data set — exactly half of the data points are above it and half below. The median is less affected by extreme outliers, so it gives a more realistic picture of a typical person's net worth.</p> \n<div id=\"5de19d764faf47bb806e13c2122d4feb\"></div> \n<p>Why does net worth vary so much between states?

So, in states with higher property values, net worths also tend to skew higher.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Income:</strong> States with higher incomes on average also typically have higher average net worths.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Local economy: </strong>Strong economies and more employment opportunities in certain states tend to positively impact overall financial well-being.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<div id=\"906274cd169644e598cef43bb80c8b9d\"></div> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-5-states-with-the-highest-net-worth\">5 states with the highest net worth</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-1-hawaii-472600\">1.

Your net worth will change over time as your financial situation evolves.

Liabilities such as credit card balances and loans can significantly reduce your net worth, even if you earn a decent income.</p> \n<p>Additionally, looking for extra ways to earn and grow your income, such as negotiating a raise or taking on a side hustle, can help you increase your savings and pay off debts.</p> \n<p>Need more ideas?

A new UK survey shows that 85% of businesses see skills gaps as a threat — and many prefer collaborating with researchers over hiring externally. Photo by Theo Moye</p>\n</div> \n<p>A new report finds that UK businesses are increasingly eager to work with university researchers to close widening skills gaps — particularly in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analysis — but struggle to access the expertise they need.</p> \n<p>The report, <i>Equipping Researchers for Impact: Unlocking the Potential of University-Business Relationships</i>, commissioned by the Developing Business-Aware Academics project at the <a href=\"https://poetsandquants.com/school-profile/university-of-exeter-business-school/\">University of Exeter Business School</a> and authored by CBI Economics, warns that skills shortages are now seen as a major threat to UK competitiveness.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>In a survey of 235 UK businesses across all sizes, sectors, and regions, an average of 85% identified skills gaps as a top concern — with shortages in AI among the most pressing.</p> \n<p><b>BIZ WANTS AI EXPERTISE — AND IT’S TURNING TO HIGHED ED TO FIND IT</b></p> \n<p>As AI continues to reshape industries and accelerate business transformation, nearly half (44%) of large companies say they would prefer to engage with academic experts in universities to address AI talent shortages rather than relying solely on external hires or outsourcing. Yet businesses often find the pathways to collaborate with academia overly complex, opaque, or poorly aligned with their immediate needs.</p> \n<p>“Businesses are expressing a clear wish to work with universities,” says Louise Hellem, chief economist at the CBI. “At a time when the UK is seeking to go further and faster in its pursuit of economic growth, as well as address chronic skills shortages and embed cutting-edge technologies across its economy, the role of universities as connectors between academic research and business innovation has never been more vital.”</p> \n<p>The findings fit into a broader trend emerging across business education. As <i>Poets&amp;Quants</i> has reported, the 2025 Graduate Business Curriculum Summary Report shows that AI is no longer treated as a niche topic, but is being embedded deeply into MBA and master’s programs. <a href=\"https://poetsandquants.com/2025/04/06/how-ai-is-reshaping-the-mba-major-new-report-offers-the-clearest-picture-yet-of-a-dramatically-changed-landscape/\">Schools are revamping curricula</a> to prioritize AI-driven decision-making, data analytics, and predictive modeling alongside traditional leadership training. Two years ago, in fall 2023, BGC reported that <a href=\"https://poetsandquants.com/2023/10/19/its-here-how-b-schools-have-steadily-cautiously-integrated-ai-into-their-curricula/\">three of four surveyed B-schools had already integrated AI into their curricula</a>.</p> \n<p>Employers are demanding it, after all. According to the 2024 GMAC <i>Corporate Recruiters Survey</i>, global employers now seek MBA graduates who possess AI and machine learning expertise — <a href=\"https://poetsandquants.com/2024/08/07/tech-ai-are-soaring-up-the-list-of-most-important-skills-recruiters-want-from-mbas-survey/\">but they equally want professionals</a> who can combine technical savvy with strategic thinking, communication skills, and leadership.</p> \n<p><b>MBA PROGRAMS RACE TO INTEGRATE AI AS EMPLOYERS SHIFT HIRING PRIORITIES</b></p> \n<p>Top programs are responding with not only curriculum changes but entire tracks — and in some cases whole programs — <a href=\"https://poetsandquants.com/2025/04/16/the-top-u-s-european-mba-programs-with-ai-concentrations/\">focused on AI</a>. Wharton, for example, recently launched a dedicated AI concentration for MBAs, and schools like INSEAD, London Business School, and MIT Sloan are embedding AI modules across core courses.</p> \n<p>Against this backdrop, the University of Exeter-CBI report warns that unless universities adapt how they prepare researchers — not just teaching technical skills, but providing sector-specific training, immersive business experiences, and networks — a huge opportunity will be missed.</p> \n<p>“Researchers are a largely untapped talent pool rich in higher-level skills,” says Professor Alison Truelove, director of the Developing Business-Aware Academics project at the University of Exeter Business School. “Support for researchers must be at the center of strategies to reshape academia-business engagement.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>“Importantly, universities and funders need to incentivize and reward researchers, and recognize that business engagement and research excellence can be mutually beneficial: they both champion innovation, offer new perspectives and open new paths to funding.”</p> \n<p><b>SCHOOLS WARNED: ADAPT RESEARCHER TRAINING OR MISS A CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY</b></p> \n<p>The survey also reveals that smaller businesses, in particular, value access to universities’ specialist facilities and consultancy but are often discouraged by the difficulty of navigating collaboration processes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Businesses across the board called for simplified engagement pathways, stronger networking initiatives connecting researchers to industry needs, and better alignment between funding opportunities and partnership goals.</p> \n<p>The report posits that universities are uniquely positioned to act as hubs for local and national economic growth — but only if they make systemic changes to reward industry collaboration alongside academic output.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>The full report, <i>Equipping Researchers for Impact: Unlocking the Potential of University-Business Relationships</i>, is available <a href=\"https://cdn.roxhillmedia.com/production/email/attachment/1710001_1720000/10d825eda9dea19f05244052a00b169d908a7d2b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p> \n<p><b>DON’T MISS <a href=\"https://poetsandquants.com/2024/08/07/tech-ai-are-soaring-up-the-list-of-most-important-skills-recruiters-want-from-mbas-survey/\">TECH &amp; AI ARE SOARING UP THE LIST OF MOST IMPORTANT SKILLS RECRUITERS WANT FROM MBAs: SURVEY </a></b><b>and <a href=\"https://poetsandquants.com/2023/10/19/its-here-how-b-schools-have-steadily-cautiously-integrated-ai-into-their-curricula/\">IT’S HERE: HOW B-SCHOOLS HAVE ‘STEADILY &amp; CAUTIOUSLY’ INTEGRATED AI INTO THEIR CURRICULA</a></b></p> \n<p>The post <a href=\"https://poetsandquants.com/2025/05/03/mba-employers-want-ai-skills-and-they-say-higher-ed-must-step-up/?pq-category=business-school-news&amp;pq-category-2=international-business-school-news&amp;pq-category-3=uk\">MBA Employers Want AI Skills — And They Say Higher Ed Must Step Up</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://poetsandquants.com\">Poets&amp;Quants</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett\">Billionaire Warren Buffett</a> shocked an arena full of shareholders Saturday by announcing that he will retire at the end of the year, bringing the curtain down on a six-decade run leading Berkshire Hathaway that made him the most influential investor in the world.</p> \n<p>Buffett said he will recommend to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-shareholders-annual-meeting-c48c85fc5e1aa24f5dd64b271e57ab2e\">Berkshire Hathaway’s board</a> on Sunday that Vice Chairman Greg Abel should replace him. </p> \n<p>“I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,” Buffett said.</p> \n<p>Abel has been Buffett's designated successor for years, and he already manages all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses. But it was always assumed that he would not take over until after Buffett's death. Previously the 94-year-old Buffett always said he had no plans to retire.</p> \n<p>Buffett announced the news at the end of a five-hour question and answer period without taking any questions about it. He said the only board members who knew this was coming were his two children, Howard and Susie Buffett. Abel, who was sitting next to Buffett on stage, had no warning.</p> \n<p>Abel returned an hour later without Buffett to conduct the company's formal business meeting, and he responded to the news.</p> \n<p>“I just want to say I couldn’t be more humbled and honored to be part of Berkshire as we go forward,” Abel said.</p> \n<p>Many investors have said they believe Abel will do a good job running Berkshire, but it remains to be seen how good he will be at investing Berkshire's cash. Buffett endorsed him Saturday by pledging to keep his fortune invested in the company.</p> \n<p>“I have no intention — zero — of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually,” Buffett said. “The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine.”</p> \n<p>Thousands of investors in the Omaha arena gave Buffett a prolonged standing ovation after his announcement in recognition of his 60 years leading the company.</p> \n<p>During that period Berkshire nearly doubled the returns of the S&amp;P 500, with a 19.9% compounded annual growth rate compared with the index’s 10.4% gain.</p> \n<p>Buffett had such a devoted following among investors that markets would move when his investments were disclosed because so many people copied him.</p> \n<p>CFRA research analyst Cathy Seifert said it had to be hard for Buffett to decide to step down.</p> \n<p>“This was probably a very tough decision for him, but better to leave on your own terms,” Seifert said. “I think there will be an effort at maintaining a ‘business as usual’ environment at Berkshire. That is still to be determined.”</p> Abel expected to do well \n<p>In many respects, Abel has already been running much of the company for years. But he hasn't been managing Berkshire's insurance operations or deciding where to invest all of its cash. He will now take those tasks on, but Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will remain to help oversee the insurance companies.</p> \n<p>Investment manager Omar Malik of Hosking Partners in London said before Buffett’s announcement that he wasn’t worried about Berkshire’s future under Abel.</p> \n<p>“Not really (worried). He’s had such a long time alongside Warren and a chance to know the businesses,” Malik said about Abel. \"The question is will he allocate capital as dynamically as Warren? And the answer is no. But I think he’ll do a fine job with the support of the others.”</p> \n<p>Cole Smead of Smead Capital Management said he wasn't surprised Buffett is stepping down after watching him Saturday because the 94-year-old wasn't as sharp as in past years. At one point, he made a basic math mistake in one of his answers. At other points, he got off track while telling stories about Berkshire and his investing without answering the question he was asked. </p> \n<p>Abel is well regarded by Berkshire's managers and Buffett has praised his business acumen for years. But he will have a hard time matching Buffett's legendary performance, and since he doesn't control 30% of Berkshire's stock like Buffett does, he won't have as much leeway.</p> \n<p>“I think the challenge he’s going to have is if anyone is going to give him Buffett or (former Vice Chairman Charlie) Munger’s pass card? Not a chance in God’s name,\" Smead said. Buffett always enjoyed a devoted following among shareholders.</p> \n<p>Buffett has said that Abel might even be a more hands-on manager than he is and get more out of Berkshire’s companies. Managers within the company say they have to be well prepared before talking to Abel because they know he will ask tough questions.</p> \n<p>Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, said he never thought he would see Buffett retire.</p> \n<p>“I didn't think he would retire while his mind is still working so well, nor did I think it'd happen at the annual meeting,” Check said. “But overall I'm very happy for him.”</p> Buffett earlier warned that Trump's tariffs were harmful \n<p>Earlier Saturday, Buffett warned of dire global consequences from President Donald Trump's tariffs while telling the thousands of investors gathered at his annual meeting that “trade should not be a weapon” but \"there's no question that trade can be an act of war.” </p> \n<p>Buffett said Trump's trade policies have raised the risk of global instability by angering the rest of the world. </p> \n<p>“It’s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don’t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,” Buffett said as he addressed the topic on everyone's mind at the start of the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting.</p> \n<p>While Buffett said it is best for trade to be balanced between countries, he doesn't think Trump is going about it the right way with his widespread tariffs. He said the world will be safer if more countries are prosperous.</p> Market turmoil doesn't create big opportunities \n<p>Buffett said he just doesn't see many attractively priced investments that he understands these days, so Berkshire is sitting on $347.7 billion in cash, but he predicted that one day Berkshire will be “bombarded with opportunities that we will be glad we have the cash for.”</p> \n<p>Buffett said the recent turmoil in the markets that generated headlines after Trump's tariff announcement last month “is really nothing.” He dismissed the recent drop as relatively small. He cited when the Dow Jones industrial average went from 240 on the day he was born in 1930 down to 41 during the Great Depression as a truly significant drop in the markets. Currently the Dow Jones Industrial Average sits at 41,317.43.</p> \n<p>“This has not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort,\" he said.</p> \n<p>Buffett said he hasn't bought back any of Berkshire's shares this year either because they don't seem to be a bargain either.</p> \n<p>Investor Chris Bloomstran, who is president of Semper Augustus Investments Group, told the Gabelli investment conference Friday that a financial crisis might be the best thing for Berkshire because it would create opportunities to invest at attractive prices.</p> \n<p>“Berkshire needs a crisis. I mean Berkshire thrives in crisis,” Bloomstran said. </p> Berkshire meeting attracts thousands \n<p>The meeting attracts some 40,000 people every year who want to hear from Buffett, including some celebrities and well-known investors. This year, Hillary Rodham Clinton also attended. Clinton was the last candidate Buffett backed publicly because he has shied away from politics and any controversial topic in recent years for fear of hurting Berkshire’s businesses. </p> \n<p>One investor even camped outside the arena overnight to be first in line.</p> \n<p>Devan Bisher, 72, said he has faith in Berkshire's future and does not plan to sell the stock he started buying in the 1980s. </p> \n<p>“It’s been a good train to ride,” Bisher said, “and I’m going to stay with it.” </p>",

The key factor is institutional investment, as measured by the amount of money flowing into <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/terms/s/spot-bitcoin-etf/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=802fd8e6-2ae5-49f6-a7cd-be1b7f93cd97\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.fool.com/terms/s/spot-bitcoin-etf/ Shift+Click to open\">spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>. Already, more than $100 billion has poured into these ETFs, and the thinking now is that the pace of inflows might actually accelerate.</p> \n<p>At the same time, Bernstein described a sort of new golden era for crypto, driven by President Donald Trump's pro-crypto and pro-Bitcoin policies. A number of big steps have already been taken -- such as the creation of the new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. And more steps are still forthcoming, such as a comprehensive new regulatory framework for the crypto market.</p> \n<h2>Bitcoin at $700,000</h2> \n<p>At the World Economic Forum in January, <strong>BlackRock</strong> CEO Larry Fink made headlines by suggesting that Bitcoin could eventually hit a price target of $700,000. Given that BlackRock is the company behind the biggest and most successful spot Bitcoin ETF -- the <strong>iShares Bitcoin Trust</strong> <span class=\"ticker\">(NASDAQ: IBIT)</span> -- it's worth listening to what he has to say.</p> \n<p>As Fink sees it, the key to Bitcoin skyrocketing to $700,000 is a higher asset allocation from large institutional investors to crypto. He used the example of sovereign wealth funds, which could be thinking about boosting their portfolio allocations to Bitcoin. If big investors decide to ratchet up their allocations to 5%, that's when the price of Bitcoin could really take off.</p> \n<h2>Bitcoin at $2.4 million</h2> \n<p>Now we're getting into really rarified air, with price predictions above $1 million. Arguably the most famous $1 million price prediction came from Cathie Wood of Ark Invest. Since that prediction, she has continued to ratchet up that price target, from $1 million to $1.48 million, and then from $1.48 million to $2.4 million.</p> \n<div class=\"image\">\n <figure>\n  <img alt=\"A hand holds a gold coin with the Bitcoin symbol on it.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6RRMOVyFVxa9iPNmRc3qVw--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/2f535bf76ce3f46737bb66903aac8218\" data-uuid=\"1fa006fe-0f8c-38c3-803f-f952bd550d65\">\n  <figcaption>\n   Image source: Getty Images.\n  </figcaption>\n </figure> \n</div> \n<p>That's a staggering price target, but the math behind it actually checks out. Every year, Ark Invest publishes its \"Big Ideas\" report, and in every report, there is a detailed breakdown of how the company arrives at its Bitcoin valuation. The valuation model focuses on six specific areas where Bitcoin is starting to gain traction.</p> \n<p>Just like the two other price forecasts above, this one from Ark Invest also focuses on institutional adoption of Bitcoin. In a bear case scenario, these investors will only allocate 1% of their money to Bitcoin. In a base case scenario, they will allocate 2.5%. And in a bull case scenario -- the scenario where Bitcoin skyrockets to $2.4 million -- that allocation rises all the way to 6.5%. The logic here is simple: The more investors allocate to Bitcoin, the higher Bitcoin is going to go.</p> \n<h2>Bitcoin at $10 million</h2> \n<p>You thought $1 million was a ridiculously high price target? Well, what about $10 million? According to Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman of <strong>Strategy</strong> <span class=\"ticker\">(NASDAQ: MSTR)</span>, formerly MicroStrategy, Bitcoin is on pace to hit the $10 million mark. In fact, last November, he suggested that Bitcoin might actually hit $13 million by 2045.</p> \n<p>At a price tag of $10 million, Bitcoin would have a total market cap of approximately $200 trillion. As a comparison, the total market cap of gold right now is approximately $20 trillion. So we're likely talking about Bitcoin becoming the most valuable asset in the world, and it won't even be close.</p> \n<p>It's up to you to decide how likely this scenario is, but you have to give Saylor credit for backing up his predictions with real-world buying of Bitcoin. Strategy is now the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, with 553,555 Bitcoins on its balance sheet. At today's prices, that's worth a cool $52 billion.</p> \n<h2>What is the most likely price trajectory for Bitcoin?</h2> \n<p>Price forecasts can change dramatically, depending on what factors prognosticators consider to be the most important. By tweaking just a few variables, it's possible to arrive at some stunning future price predictions.</p> \n<p>The big question for the near term is how Bitcoin will hold up under the weight of global tariffs. Ultimately, if money pours into Bitcoin from investors looking for a long-term store of value, some of the more outlandishly bullish price targets might turn out to be closer to reality than many people might think.</p>\n<h2>Should you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?</h2> \n<p>Before you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:</p> \n<p>The <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=e9f098ce-0421-46fc-8f53-c42206eaa787&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0001088%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D17500&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=802fd8e6-2ae5-49f6-a7cd-be1b7f93cd97\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

(AP) — Warren Buffett's company reported just over one-third of last year's profit Saturday a few hours before <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-shareholders-annual-meeting-a421061233f99859673fb131ce020d4d\">Buffett announced plans to retire</a> as Berkshire Hathaway’s CEO at the end of the year. </p> \n<p>Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel will take over as CEO as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett\">Buffett has long planned.</a> Abel has already been overseeing all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses for years, but he will now take on responsibility for also overseeing the many insurance companies and deciding how to invest all of the conglomerate's cash.</p> \n<p>The profit numbers were weighed down by a major drop in the value of its investments and $860 million in insurance losses related to policies that its insurance companies wrote before the devastating Southern California wildfires.</p> \n<p>Berkshire said it earned $4.6 billion, or $3,200 per Class A share, in the first quarter. That's down from $12.7 billion, or $8,825 per Class A share, last year. </p> \n<p>But Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire’s operating earnings because those exclude the value of its investments, which can vary widely from quarter to quarter. Berkshire must include the value of its investments in its bottom line numbers even though it hasn’t sold most of them.</p> \n<p>By that measure, Berkshire's earnings were still down 14% at $9.6 billion, or $6,703.41 per A share. Last year, the conglomerate reported operating earnings of $11.2 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share.</p> \n<p>The analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted Berkshire would report operating earnings of $7,076.90 per Class A share.</p> \n<p>Buffett's comments were the main attraction Saturday and his surprise retirement announcement overshadowed everything else.</p> \n<p>But investors have been wondering why Berkshire is now sitting on $347.7 billion cash as of the end of the first quarter, up from $334.2 billion at the end of the year. Buffett told shareholders that he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands. And he said the market didn't really drop enough in April to catch his attention.</p> \n<p>Buffett told shareholders that he nearly spent $10 billion on a deal recently but that fell through and he didn't disclose the details.</p> \n<p>Many of Berkshire's myriad businesses like BNSF railroad and its assortment of manufacturing and retail businesses tend to follow the economy. Berkshire said Saturday that its future results may be affected by geopolitical events and trade policy, but it's impossible to predict what will happen. </p> \n<p>“The pace of changes in these events, including international trade policies and tariffs, has accelerated in 2025. Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events,” Berkshire said in the report. </p> \n<p>But during the quarter, earnings improved at BNSF and Berkshire's utility division while the manufacturing and retail businesses held steady. The main area where operating profits fell was in insurance underwriting, weighed down by the wildfire losses.</p> \n<p>Geico's underwriting profits were actually up at $2.2 billion from last year's $1.9 billion. The results at reinsurance and primary insurance groups dragged down the insurance results.</p> \n<p>But Berkshire managers — just like every CEO — are worrying about the potential impact of tariffs on their business. Dairy Queen CEO Troy Bader said their restaurants should be able to weather the trade war OK even thought they have thousands of locations in China because most of its ingredients are sourced locally.</p> \n<p>But the tariffs are a greater concern to other Berkshire businesses like Brooks Running, which makes all of its shoes in Vietnam and Indonesia. Brooks CEO Dan Sheridan said his company will likely have to raise its prices because of the tariffs, but he is still waiting to see exactly which tariffs go into effect. </p> \n<p>Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders said the results appear solid outside of the wildfire losses, but Berkshire continued to be a net seller of stocks by unloading $1.5 billion more than it bought during the quarter. That contributed to the growing cash pile that’s more than double where it was a year ago as Buffett has largely stayed on the sidelines while selling off much of Berkshire’s Apple stake.</p> \n<p>But Buffett still praised Apple CEO Tim Cook, who is attending the Berkshire shareholders meeting, for all the money he has made Berkshire.</p> \n<p>Berkshire Hathaway owns dozens of companies, including Geico, BNSF railroad, a collection of massive utilities and an assortment of retail and manufacturing businesses including well-known brands like See's Candy. It also holds a massive stock portfolio.</p>",

Where can I put it to make the most amount of passive income from it? Also, how can I minimize taxes on that to be able to keep more of that money?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>– Andrea</strong></p> \n<p>While today’s high-interest rate environment has been challenging in many respects, the silver lining is that investors seeking to earn <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/passive-income\">passive income</a> can do so more easily than they could at any point since the global financial crisis of 2007-2009.</p> \n<p>Before laying out some options to capitalize on prevailing yields and considering the associated tax consequences, it’s helpful to evaluate your existing financial picture and ask yourself some important questions that will impact where you put the money. (A financial advisor can help you do both and <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=askanadvisorpassiveincomeoptions\">this tool can help you match with one</a>.)</p> \n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Evaluate Your Financial Situation</h2> \n<p>Investing your $1 million dollars with an eye toward generating passive income may very well be the best option for this money. However, rather than viewing your decision in a vacuum, I would recommend looking at the money in the context of your broader financial situation and longer-term goals. In particular, it might be helpful to consider the following questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Your total assets:</strong> Do you already have a portfolio of investments? Where are those assets located and what are their tax implications (e.g., IRA, Roth IRA, 401(k), brokerage account)?</li> \n <li><strong>Your work status</strong>: How many more years will you have an income to add to your assets?</li> \n <li><strong>Other income: </strong>Do you have any other sources of income (Social Security, pension, etc.)?</li> \n <li><strong>Purpose for generating passive income:</strong> Are you retired and seeking to fund your ongoing expenses? Or is it to provide supplementary income while the rest of your portfolio continues to grow?</li> \n <li><strong>Growth vs. income:</strong> Are you willing and/or able to sacrifice growth and preservation of purchasing power for the sake of income? If income is the only goal or need, then expectations for growth and your ability to maintain the purchasing power of the assets should remain low.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>It is possible that after thinking through these questions you might pursue a different goal for the money. (And if you need more help assessing your financial situation, <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=askanadvisorpassiveincomeoptions\">consider speaking with a financial advisor</a>.)</p> \n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Options for Generating Passive Income</h2> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"An investor looks over several options for generating passive income. \" class=\"wp-image-218412\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4t1Zn2URhLsSsuNeo34bUQ--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/smartasset_475/5830eee399cd88947b051cf7fd606a5d\" width=\"728\" data-uuid=\"c711ca08-564c-3997-919a-585a2958e049\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Given the rise in interest rates since March 2022, income-oriented assets have become more attractive for those looking to earn a reasonable yield from their investments. Building a portfolio that includes a variety of assets capable of generating an aggregate yield is often a sound approach, as opposed to investing in a single product or security. While a <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=askanadvisorpassiveincomeoptions\">financial advisor</a> can help you build a robust portfolio, here are a few options to consider:</p> \n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Money Market Funds</h3> \n<p>While generally considered an alternative to holding cash in a savings account, <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/investing/money-market-funds\">money market funds</a> have become a popular topic among investors amid rate increases. Prior to the Federal Reserve’s recent series of rate hikes, money market yields were close to 0%, meaning you effectively earned no interest on your investment. Today, however, yields are closer to 5%, making this a much more compelling option for generating low-risk income.</p> \n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Municipal Bonds</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://smartasset.com/investing/what-are-tax-free-municipal-bonds\">Municipal bonds</a> are another solid option for income-focused investors. As with any investment, you’ll want to consider your goals before investing in municipal bonds since the risk profile and income potential will vary across securities. Evaluating credit ratings and maturities in relation to the yield you expect to earn in exchange for taking on credit and duration risk is a necessary step to take. Because they are typically not subject to federal taxes (or state taxes in the state where they are issued), municipal bonds tend to be a tax-efficient investment.</p> \n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Certificates of Deposit</h3> \n<p>Like money market funds, <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/checking-account/what-is-a-certificate-of-deposit\">certificates of deposit</a> (CDs) have gained popularity as rates have increased. CDs can be particularly attractive if you do not need to liquidate the investment over its intended time horizon since you generally will pay a penalty for early withdrawals. It is therefore important to align a CD’s maturity date with the date at which you expect to need the money back.</p> \n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dividend Stocks</h3> \n<p>If you will need some growth to accompany the passive income your money generates, you may want to consider investing in dividend stocks. The S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index was paying a dividend yield in excess of 5% as of the end of September, making it competitive with other options listed. Unlike fixed-income products, <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-dividend-stocks\">dividend stocks</a> will typically provide more opportunity for appreciation, which may help you maintain purchasing power over time if that’s a concern.</p> \n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other Options</h3> \n<p>Of course, there are additional options for generating passive income. These include Treasuries, high-yield bonds, <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/financial-advisor/master-limited-partnerships-mlp\">master limited partnerships</a> (MLPs), <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/mortgage/how-to-invest-in-real-estate-using-reits\">real estate investment trusts</a> (REITs) and many others. Before committing to each, consider the level of risk you are able and willing to take, the amount of income you will need, and whether some element of growth is necessary. Also, evaluate the tax implications of the investments you choose. (And if you need more help evaluating and selecting investments, <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=askanadvisorpassiveincomeoptions\">consider matching with a financial advisor</a>.)</p> \n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mitigate the Impact of Taxes</h2> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"A couple meets with a financial advisor to go over tax mitigation strategies. \" class=\"wp-image-218413\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zc2ViuSDbovH76crz8KHQQ--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/smartasset_475/56d1640152cb3a2aff13592f60ead2f9\" width=\"728\" data-uuid=\"8215132f-2594-3f6e-9408-e0159f2754b0\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Each of the options cited above is treated differently for tax purposes. The interest earned by fixed-income securities is taxed at <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes\">ordinary income tax rates</a>. Taxes on dividends from equity securities depend on how long you own the asset – qualified dividends are taxed at long-term <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator\">capital gains</a> rates while ordinary dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates. Appreciation from equity securities is taxed at capital gains rates.</p> \n<p>It’s important to understand the tax treatment of individual assets since that will play a role in determining the type of account that holds these assets. Generally speaking, owning individual stocks and bonds, as well as their passively managed index alternatives, is more tax-efficient than actively managed mutual funds. Therefore, it’s typically advisable to own individual stocks, bonds and index funds in taxable brokerage accounts. Tax-advantaged accounts like <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/ira-vs-401k\">IRAs and 401(k)s</a>, and after-tax <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/what-is-a-roth-ira\">Roth IRAs</a>, are generally more suitable for your actively managed funds and less tax-efficient securities like high-yield bonds.</p> \n<p>Thinking holistically about the assets you own and <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/financial-advisor/asset-location\">where to allocate them</a> will ultimately help you mitigate taxes. Of course, it can be helpful to speak with your tax advisor to better understand the impact on your individual situation, given your specific tax brackets. (Consider matching with a <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=askanadvisorpassiveincomeoptions\">financial advisor</a> with tax expertise.)</p> \n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bottom Line</h2> \n<p>Positioning your assets for passive income generation is a sound strategy, but only if it aligns with your long-term financial needs and goals. Before committing to this approach, critically assess your personal situation and the rationale behind seeking passive income. From there, you may consider various fixed-income products like bonds and CDs, as well as equity securities like dividend-paying stocks. Each option has its own tax consequences, and the type of account the securities are held in will also have an impact on taxes.</p> \n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tips for Generating Passive Income</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>A <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/checking-account/how-to-build-a-cd-ladder\">CD ladder</a> is one way to capitalize on today’s high-interest rate environment while also generating income. The strategy calls for opening multiple CD accounts, each with varying maturity dates. The idea is that you’ll always have a CD reaching its maturity date and paying out interest.

An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation.

However, REITs are only as safe as the businesses they lease to. When some of their tenants suffer financially, they do too.</p> \n<p>That's what happened to MPT. Over the past three years, two of its tenants -- including its (now) former largest -- filed for bankruptcy. MPT's rentals and <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/terms/f/ffo/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=a09c01d3-b8e6-473a-b6fe-7b7b5f018613\" target=\"_blank\">funds from operations</a> (FFO) dropped. The company had no choice but to cut its dividend.</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"MPW Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fzWGNZPx7F_mLFP7gaygfQ--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/4d8bcec765416e9ebc4df5707ffa9784\" data-uuid=\"fd5641e1-e2bc-3da2-a468-6a76b105a1ea\">\n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/MPW/chart/\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/MPW/revenues\">MPW Revenue (Quarterly)</a> data by \n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\">YCharts</a>.\n  <br>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>Income seekers don't like to see a payout cut, but it was a necessary evil for MPT to improve its business. Facing the loss of its largest tenant and substantial financial troubles, the company managed to craft a comeback plan. It sold some properties to raise money while finding new tenants for others that were previously occupied by its former tenants, who had declared bankruptcy.</p> \n<p>MPT also strengthened its balance sheet and improved its financial flexibility. It used the proceeds from the sale of various facilities and other sources to pay down significant amounts of debt, totaling $2.2 billion since the beginning of 2023. The company addressed all debt maturities through 2026, and also refinanced existing debt.</p> \n<p>All these transactions give MPT a much stronger financial foundation. That's not to mention the fact that, by putting several new tenants in old facilities, it has significantly diversified its operations; it's now far less susceptible to serious financial trouble because of the shortcomings of just one or two tenants.</p> \n<p>MPT still isn't getting the full rental revenue from its newest tenants. They'll gradually increase the amount they pay until they match 100% of the agreed terms by the fourth quarter of next year. In other words, it will still take some time for revenue and FFO to improve significantly. But I don't foresee the company encountering more serious issues and having to cut its dividend again.</p> \n<h2>There might be plenty of upside left</h2> \n<p>MPT's shares have crushed the market this year; they're up by 45% year to date. There are several reasons for that.</p> \n<p>First, the stock was so beaten down that it had become undervalued, and opportunistic investors pounced despite the broader issues affecting equities. Second, dividend payers are exactly what investors look for in a challenging economic environment. Third, MPT is a REIT focusing on healthcare, a sector that will remain in high demand even if inflation or a recession hits because of the impact of tariffs.</p> \n<p>MPT has encountered severe issues in recent years. However, it has taken steps to get back on track, and investors now have a much improved outlook on the company. That said, its shares are still down over the past three years. Even after the recent rally, the stock has lost a whopping 70% of its value:</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"MPW Chart\" src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1Hgi0vmWK8Dm7HRSl4hh3A--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/b7971256117cab10939dceb028319d3a\" data-uuid=\"e9c431c7-ef18-3306-a2d4-ac926d71716d\">\n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/MPW/chart/\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/MPW\">MPW</a> data by \n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\">YCharts</a>.\n  <br>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>True, MPT's turnaround isn't exactly complete, and there's still some risk involved. Unforeseen company-specific troubles could disrupt its plan -- recovering companies have very little margin for error. Also, the current economic situation could evolve in completely unpredictable ways.</p> \n<p>Even so, MPT's work to get past its issues over the past three years, and the fact that its share price is still down significantly, make it a stock worth considering. I wouldn't bet the farm on the stock, but it might be worth it for income seekers to initiate a small position and progressively add more shares if the company continues to improve.</p>\n<h2>Should you invest $1,000 in Medical Properties Trust right now?</h2> \n<p>Before you buy stock in Medical Properties Trust, consider this:</p> \n<p>The <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=86a3310a-3daa-4cfb-ac85-d7ddbb43e4bc&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0001088%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D17500&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=a09c01d3-b8e6-473a-b6fe-7b7b5f018613\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now… and Medical Properties Trust wasn’t one of them.

Doing so can boost your monthly benefit by up to 24%. However, delaying Social Security will mean you’ll have to rely more heavily on your savings for several years and potentially take a large bite out of your nest egg. So is the tradeoff worth it? A <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=1millionsavingspensiondelaysocialsecurity401k5years\">financial advisor</a> can review income sources and expenses and help you budget for a comfortable retirement.</p> \n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Basics of Paying for Retirement</h2> \n<p>Funding retirement is about having enough income to cover your expenses. You may be ready to retire when your retirement income matches or exceeds your anticipated expenses.</p> \n<p>For most people, the secure lifetime benefits from <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/what-is-social-security\">Social Security</a> represent a critical source of retirement income. Additional income may come from <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/what-is-a-pension-plan\">pensions</a>, <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/retirement-plan-types\">retirement accounts</a> like 401(k)s and IRAs, <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/investing/investing-in-rental-property-for-beginners\">rental income</a> from investment properties and <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/jobs-for-retirees\">part-time work</a>.</p> \n<p>On the <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/how-to-estimate-your-expenses-in-retirement\">expense</a> side, essentials include housing, food and healthcare. Most people also have discretionary expenditures like transportation, entertainment, recreation, education and travel.</p> \n<p>People with enough savings can afford to delay Social Security and use their nest egg to cover living expenses and discretionary spending. While delaying Social Security can increase your eventual benefits, it also means depleting savings faster. Making this decision will require you to consider all of your sources of income as well as factors like taxes, market fluctuations and inflation.</p> \n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Delaying Social Security: The 8% Annual Boost</h2> \n<p>Your benefit grows by about 8% annually each year you <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/the-benefits-of-delaying-social-security\">delay Social Security</a> beyond your <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/full-retirement-age\">full retirement age</a> – up until age 70. So, waiting provides a significantly higher income later. On the flip side, if you claim your benefits before reaching full retirement age, you’ll get less.</p> \n<p>For instance, if your benefit is $2,000 per month at full retirement age, claiming at 62 would cut it by 30%, leaving you with just $1,400 per month. Waiting until age 70, on the other hand, would boost your monthly check to around $2,480 per month – a 24% increase.</p> \n<p>Financial advisors say it likely makes sense for many retirees to similarly delay taking Social Security if they have other income sources.</p> \n<p>“The longer you can defer Social Security, the better because your benefit will grow by 8% annually,” said Jeremy Suschak, a certified financial planner (CFP) and head of business development at <a href=\"https://www.dbroot.com/\">DBR &amp; Co.</a> in Pittsburgh. “Delaying also makes sense if expenses are low, debts are paid and assets can reasonably cover expenses.”</p> \n<p>In addition, there are multiple benefits to having assets in diversified retirement accounts, says Hao Dang, an accredited investment fiduciary (AIF) and investment strategist with <a href=\"https://www.consiliowealth.com/\">Consilio Wealth Advisors</a> in Seattle.</p> \n<p>“The location of assets is important for tax, legal and diversification reasons,” Dang said.</p> \n<p>“While most distributions from these accounts qualify as taxable income, the eligible age of penalty-free distributions may be different. The <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/401k-55-rule\">rule of 55</a> for 401(k)s allows for penalty-free withdrawals if you are no longer at your job. IRAs are limited to 59 ½ or older.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=1millionsavingspensiondelaysocialsecurity401k5years\">Talk to a financial advisor today</a> to make a plan for retirement.</p> \n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Example: $1 Million Saver Who Delays Social Security for 8 Years</h2> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"A woman reviews her 401(k) as she considers when the best time for claiming Social Security. \" class=\"wp-image-216498\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NHmDCXVMS0xxPYqIoRnLRg--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/smartasset_475/83f0a0e3e037d015a681e6a6491491a2\" width=\"728\" data-uuid=\"ce113caf-01c9-3ccc-8e14-f5cebb49e84d\"> \n</figure> \n<p>While claiming later increases Social Security significantly, deciding whether or not to delay claiming requires figuring out how you’ll pay your bills in the meantime. Consider a 62-year-old with anticipated retirement expenses of $5,000 per month. Like you, he has $1 million in retirement savings earning a 5% annual return.</p> \n<p>He also has a pension that provides $700 monthly, or $8,400 annually. This is approximately the average pension benefit, according to a 2022 <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2022/demo/p70br-177.pdf\">Census Bureau</a> analysis of older household income sources.</p> \n<p>If he takes Social Security at 62, his $1,400 monthly benefit plus his $700 in monthly pension income will add up to $2,100. With $5,000 in expenses every month, he’ll need to withdraw $2,900 a month from his retirement account. And with inflation, that withdrawal will increase over time to maintain the same lifestyle. With this route, he loses roughly $25,000 of his savings to waiting for Social Security – money that could have otherwise been generating investment returns for the long-term.</p> \n<p>But if he delays Social Security until 70, he’ll need to withdraw $4,300 from his 401(k) for eight years, which would lower his balance to just over $800,000 by the time he turns 70. At that point, he’ll start collecting Social Security.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=1millionsavingspensiondelaysocialsecurity401k5years\">financial advisor</a> can help you understand the pros and cons of your options.</p> \n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Limitations: Inflation, Market Returns and Longevity</h2> \n<p>Deciding when to claim Social Security involves contemplating uncertainty. One big risk is that your investment returns may fall short of your assumptions, which means you’ll either have to withdraw less or accept that your money won’t last as long as you anticipated.</p> \n<p>Another possibility: Inflation could outpace long-term projections, requiring you to spend more money to maintain your standard of living. Living longer than expected meanwhile, carries its own set of risks. A longer lifespan means more years of retirement to fund.</p> \n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Making the Call on Delaying Social Security</h2> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"A woman weighs her options for claiming Social Security at age 62 or delaying them for several years. \" class=\"wp-image-216497\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dhjVr4hvJ5_IxGCbc44pyQ--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/smartasset_475/b5e8b532a6b1ff08d0c0c2768538a803\" width=\"728\" data-uuid=\"a1f07a22-7586-38d1-a90d-449ea67edf65\"> \n</figure> \n<p>If you have substantial retirement savings and a pension, delaying Social Security can pay off. But first, make sure you can afford to fund expenses from savings. Create a retirement budget accounting for all income sources. See if you can meet spending needs on savings alone for several years.</p> \n<p>Next, calculate your increased Social Security benefit from delaying. Weigh if the boost is worth shrinking savings for a few years. Finally, consider other factors like spousal benefits, taxes and unknowns like inflation, market volatility and longevity.

So, the employee would make after-tax contributions to their own accounts, and the employer would match those with pre-tax dollars. SECURE 2.0 allows for employers to make matching contributions directly into their employees’ Roth 401(k) accounts.</p> \n<p>That choice is up to the employer to make. They can choose to make pre-tax matches, after-tax matches or forgo matching contributions altogether. It’s important to know what kind of matching is in place because it will affect several things including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Your current income taxes</li> \n <li>Your income taxes in retirement</li> \n <li>Potential tax issues when you roll over your Roth 401(k) into a Roth IRA</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If your employer offers pre-tax matching, that money and any growth attached to it will be taxed on withdrawal. If your employer chooses to make matching Roth contributions, you’ll get a <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/taxes/what-is-a-1099-r-form\">Form 1099-R</a> for that amount for the tax year in which the contribution is actually made. For example, if your employer matches your 2024 contributions but not until January 2025, you will get the 1099-R for tax year 2025. The amount on the 1099-R gets added to your taxable income for that year. (If you run into tax questions concerning your employer matches, consider <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=askanadvisortaxesonrothrollover\">seeking out a financial advisor</a> with tax planning expertise.)</p> \n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rolling Over a Roth 401(k) to a Roth IRA</h2> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"A woman looks over her Roth 401(k) balance and considers rolling it over into a Roth IRA. \" class=\"wp-image-249488\" height=\"2173\" src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Upr8weL6CYK3uPtFYJ0vzg--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/smartasset_475/885f52647d5907e6fd76fdf22dd9202c\" width=\"3864\" data-uuid=\"55b827fb-1993-3717-90bc-f9b53fcfe1ad\"> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s easy to roll over your Roth 401(k) into a Roth IRA. First, you need to have a Roth IRA in place to accept the rollover. Then, all you have to do is ask your 401(k) provider to complete a <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/direct-rollover\">direct rollover</a>, where they send the money from your Roth 401(k) electronically into your Roth IRA.</p> \n<p>Doing a direct rollover allows you to avoid the mandatory income tax withholding – usually 20% – that applies when you receive a check from your plan administrator. This is known as an <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/indirect-rollover\">indirect rollover</a>. If you do get a check, you’ll have 60 days to deposit the full amount of the rollover into your Roth IRA to avoid tax consequences. That means you’ll have to replace the amount that’s withheld for taxes or risk that portion being considered a non-qualified distribution, triggering income taxes and possibly a <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/taxes/ira-penalty-for-early-withdrawal\">10% early withdrawal penalty</a>.</p> \n<p>If your account includes any pre-tax money, such as employer matches, you’ll have to pay income tax on those funds if you roll them into a Roth IRA. You also have the option of rolling those pre-tax funds into a traditional IRA to avoid a current tax bill. (A <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=askanadvisortaxesonrothrollover\">financial advisor</a> can help you decide whether rolling retirement savings over into an IRA makes sense for you.)</p> \n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Five-Year Rule</h2> \n<p>Keep in mind that Roth accounts come with a five-year lock period. To clinch all the tax benefits of the Roth account, it must open for at least five years. The clock starts with the first contribution into the Roth account.</p> \n<p>If you roll your Roth 401(k) into a Roth IRA, the five-year clock switches to the Roth IRA. For example, if you had a Roth 401(k) for seven years and rolled it over into a newly established Roth IRA in 2024, you’d have to wait until 2029 to take qualified withdrawals. But if the receiving Roth IRA has already been open and funded for four years, you’d only have to wait one more year to satisfy this <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/financial-advisor/ask-an-advisor-5-year-rule-roth-conversion\">five-year rule</a>.</p> \n<p>(However, there are more than one five-year rule and they can be tricky to navigate. Having a <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=askanadvisortaxesonrothrollover\">financial advisor</a> in your corner can help you better understand these rules and avoid the tax consequences of breaking them.)</p> \n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bottom Line</h2> \n<p>You shouldn’t owe any taxes if you do a direct rollover of a Roth 401(k) into a Roth IRA. If you think your Roth 401(k) may contain pre-tax funds (such as employer matches), you’ll owe income taxes on the money if you choose to roll it over into the Roth IRA. You can also transfer those funds into a traditional IRA and preserve their tax-deferred status. However, consult a financial professional for the best way to handle that portion of your retirement money.</p> \n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Retirement Planning Tips</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>A financial advisor can potentially help you plan and save for retirement. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=askanadvisortaxesonrothrollover\">matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors</a> who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you.

SmartAsset’s retirement calculator can help you estimate how much your savings could be worth by the time you retire, as well as how much annual income your portfolio can generate.</li> \n <li>Keep an <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/personal-finance/how-to-build-an-emergency-fund\">emergency fund</a> on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid – in an account that isn’t at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. <a href=\"https://article.smartasset.com/compare-financial-products/\">Compare savings accounts from these banks</a>.</li> \n <li>Are you a financial advisor looking to grow your business?

More importantly, let's explore why another emerging software business could be the better buy as it has the potential to eclipse Palantir's size over the next several years.</p> \n<h2>Palantir's rise has been epic, but...</h2> \n<p>Palantir was founded over 20 years ago. For most of its history, the company concentrated on the public sector -- working closely with the U.S. military and its allies in the defense world. Given the lumpy nature of government contracting, Wall Street was skeptical of Palantir's growth potential when the company went public in 2020. Some skeptics viewed Palantir as a consulting agent for the government and not so much a high-flying software business.</p> \n<p>This narrative started changing exactly two years ago. In April 2023, Palantir released its fourth major enterprise tool, called the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). In the table below, I've summarized some key performance indicators around Palantir's business prior to and following the release of AIP.</p> \n<table border=\"1\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <th scope=\"col\">Category</th> \n   <th scope=\"col\">Q1 2022 (Prior to AIP)</th> \n   <th scope=\"col\">Q4 2024 (Latest Published Financials)</th> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Government customers</td> \n   <td class=\"txtC\">93</td> \n   <td class=\"txtC\">140</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Commercial customers</td> \n   <td class=\"txtC\">184</td> \n   <td class=\"txtC\">571</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Total revenue</td> \n   <td class=\"txtC\">$446 million</td> \n   <td class=\"txtC\">$827 million</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Net income</td> \n   <td class=\"txtC\">($101 million)</td> \n   <td class=\"txtC\">$79 million</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Adjusted free cash flow</td> \n   <td class=\"txtC\">$29.8 million</td> \n   <td class=\"txtC\">$517.4 million</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p class=\"caption\">Data source: Palantir.</p> \n<p>The growth speaks for itself. AIP has been a transformative piece of infrastructure for Palantir, allowing the company to swiftly penetrate the private sector, accelerate revenue, and widen profit margins. While Palantir deserves a lot of credit, investors may be getting a little too excited. In just two years, the company's market capitalization has ballooned by more than 17 times. To add another layer of perspective here, Palantir currently trades for 100 times its trailing-12-month sales.</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"PLTR Market Cap Chart\" src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a4WTuY5GhzihIT78AC6wcw--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/c0b255110085d00a10d4b3226190e63b\" data-uuid=\"b2347a7a-3fdf-32d2-ab0b-3ad219ce0bde\">\n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/PLTR/chart/\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/PLTR/market_cap\">PLTR Market Cap</a> data by \n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\">YCharts</a>.\n  <br>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>Right now, smart investors are wondering when Palantir will hit its ceiling. While AI should remain a long-run tailwind for the company, there will come a time when its valuation multiples begin to normalize. Over the next five years, expectations are likely to be higher and higher with each passing earnings report. My hunch is that the triple-digit returns from Palantir stock may be in the rearview mirror for the time being. By 2030, I would not be surprised if Palantir's valuation is largely unchanged compared to where it is today.</p> \n<div class=\"image\">\n <figure>\n  <img alt=\"A digital padlock on top of a motherboard.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Q6Ff.tpRWvKgox3Nz6BhRg--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/ed7ba05a4d02c2e25be5ea662154e64e\" data-uuid=\"002da6c3-f795-3dca-a07f-601f8acf2ad1\">\n  <figcaption>\n   Image source: Getty Images.\n  </figcaption>\n </figure> \n</div> \n<h2>...this other software player could be more dominant in the long run</h2> \n<p>The software company that I think has more potential than Palantir over the next five years is cybersecurity firm <strong>CrowdStrike</strong> <span class=\"ticker\">(NASDAQ: CRWD)</span>. In the world of investing, CrowdStrike has become somewhat polarizing over the last year due to a high-profile security outage featuring the company's software.</p> \n<p>The biggest tailwind I see for CrowdStrike in the coming years is the company's unique positioning at the intersection of two large, and expanding, total addressable markets (TAMs): AI and cybersecurity. According to Statista, the TAM for AI in cybersecurity is expected to reach $134 billion by 2030 -- a more than fourfold increase compared to its size at the end of 2024.</p> \n<p>While the security outage last summer brought on much in the way of negative PR, CrowdStrike has chugged along and been performing quite well over the last several quarters. Despite any perceived reputational damage, the company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) continues to grow at an impressive clip and its ability to generate consistent free cash flow doesn't appear to be in jeopardy.</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"CRWD Revenue (TTM) Chart\" src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/U3sblNA73V.1H3b02gTEaA--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/9f18a87b9617bf83402008efb9e18cf2\" data-uuid=\"815f6662-cfaf-38cf-8e11-ff4fd96c0194\">\n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/CRWD/chart/\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/CRWD/revenues_ttm\">CRWD Revenue (TTM)</a> data by \n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\">YCharts</a>.\n  <br>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h2>Is CrowdStrike stock a buy right now?</h2> \n<p>Similar to Palantir, CrowdStrike stock trades at a premium. In fact, CrowdStrike trades at the highest P/S ratio when benchmarked against a large peer group of leading cybersecurity businesses.</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"CRWD PS Ratio Chart\" src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MWK8PMtfMI9rCfs_AOtHZw--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/b6f1c65d8759ee97cf4008434237024e\" data-uuid=\"a766f9db-c514-3646-9231-fc48324574cd\">\n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/CRWD/chart/\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/CRWD/ps_ratio\">CRWD PS Ratio</a> data by \n  <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\">YCharts</a>.\n  <br>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>In a way, though, I think this premium suggests that growth investors are looking past the company's hiccups from last year and have bought into the long-run growth narrative surrounding AI and cybersecurity. Taking this one step further, despite CrowdStrike's premium, its current P/S multiple is actually slightly lower than where it was last year prior to the security outage -- as illustrated above around the July 2024 time frame.</p> \n<p>I see CrowdStrike as a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity over the next several years and think the company's growth potential is in its early chapters. For these reasons, I think CrowdStrike has more tailwinds compared to Palantir, and I see the company becoming a higher-valued business by next decade.</p>\n<h2>Should you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?</h2> \n<p>Before you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:</p> \n<p>The <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=c3447a2e-8042-44fb-b3f5-5cce82f4135a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0001088%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D17500&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=cc18032b-43d0-4cd2-bbb2-cd629945159d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now… and CrowdStrike wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "<p>By Jonathan Stempel and Carolina Mandl </p> \n<p> OMAHA, Nebraska/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday posted a lower operating profit in the first quarter, dented by insurance losses from wildfires and foreign currency changes, while its cash stake grew to a record $347.7 billion. </p> \n<p> Operating profit for the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate dropped 14% to $9.64 billion, or about $6,703 per Class A share, from $11.22 billion a year earlier. </p> \n<p> Net income was down 64% to $4.6 billion, or $3,200 per Class A share, from $12.7 billion, reflecting unrealized losses on common stock holdings including Apple. </p> \n<p> The cash stake grew from $334.2 billion at year-end, reflecting Berkshire's difficulty finding things to buy. </p> \n<p> It repurchased none of its own stock for a third straight quarter, and was a net seller of stocks for a 10th straight quarter, buying $3.18 billion and selling $4.68 billion. </p> \n<p> Berkshire said little about how U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies affected results. </p> \n<p> It said in its quarterly report that \"considerable uncertainty remains,\" and Berkshire was \"unable to reliably predict\" the potential impact on the company, including as to product costs, supply chain costs and customer demand. </p> \n<p> Results included $1.1 billion of losses on insurance claims stemming from the Los Angeles-area wildfires in January. </p> \n<p> That caused overall net income from insurance to fall by nearly half, to $1.34 billion. </p> \n<p> The wildfire losses offset continued improvement at the Geico car insurer, as increased premiums and reduced accident claims helped push pre-tax underwriting profit up 13%. </p> \n<p> Results also included $713 million of currency-related losses as the U.S. dollar weakened, compared with a $597 million gain a year earlier. </p> \n<p> The results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city. </p> \n<p> Buffett, 94, has led Berkshire for 60 years, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate whose businesses include Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Dairy Queen and See's Candies. </p> \n<p> Berkshire shares have far outperformed the broader market in 2025, with many investors viewing the company as a safe haven from potential disruptions to the economy, including from tariffs. </p> \n<p> In other businesses, tariffs may have temporarily helped the BNSF railroad, where profit rose 6%. </p> \n<p> BNSF reported higher volumes for consumer products, including west coast imports and automotive vehicles, which suggests higher demand for shipments before tariffs kicked in. </p> \n<p> Berkshire Hathaway Energy also fared better, increasing profit 53% through broad-based gains and a lower loss at the HomeServices real estate brokerage unit. </p> \n<p> Profit fell 1% at Berkshire's manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. </p> \n<p> Berkshire's collection of car dealerships benefited from higher sales of new and use vehicles. </p> \n<p> But home furnishings and other retailing businesses struggled with what Berkshire called \"increased competition, sluggish demand and impacts of higher economic uncertainty.\" </p> \n<p> (Reporting by Carolina Mandl in New York, and Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; editing by Barbara Lewis, Kevin Liffey and Diane Craft) </p>",

GOBankingRates spoke with Henry Silva, wealth management advisor at Apollon Wealth Management, about why the ultra-rich should <a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com/retirement/planning/reasons-you-might-regret-moving-to-florida-for-retirement/?hyperlink_type=manual&amp;utm_term=incontent_link_3&amp;utm_campaign=1304586&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_content=4&amp;utm_medium=rss\">think twice before uprooting their lives and moving to Florida</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tax Incentives Might Not Be Enough of a Reason for Wealthy Americans To Move To Florida</h2>\n<p>Although Silva himself lives in Miami, he noted that moving to Florida won’t be the right choice for everyone.</p>\n<p>“For high-net-worth families, Florida’s no state income tax alone shouldn’t be the deciding factor when considering a major relocation,” he said. “The financial picture here is far more complex than a single tax line item.”</p>\n<p>For one, there are certain necessities high-net-worth individuals will likely <a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/economy/states-where-you-pay-more-than-average-living-costs/?hyperlink_type=manual&amp;utm_term=incontent_link_4&amp;utm_campaign=1304586&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_content=5&amp;utm_medium=rss\">pay more for</a> in Florida.</p>\n<p>“Home insurance premiums have skyrocketed,” Silva said. “Whether it’s clients, friends or family, nearly everyone I know has faced a significant increase in their premiums, sometimes unexpectedly. And it’s not just in Miami — this is impacting properties across the state.</p>\n<p>“Add to that the cost of property taxes, flood zone assessments and limited public school options depending on the area, and suddenly, the move doesn’t feel quite as tax-efficient,” he said.</p>\n<p>Silva believes that the move “has to make sense beyond taxes.” </p>\n<p>“It should align with your lifestyle and long-term vision,” he said. “Without that, you’re just chasing trends, and trends can be expensive.”</p>\n<p><strong>Find Out: <a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com//money/wealth/suze-orman-top-tip-building-wealth-easy-one/?hyperlink_type=manual&amp;utm_term=related_link_2&amp;utm_campaign=1304586&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_content=6&amp;utm_medium=rss\" rel=\"\">Suze Orman’s Top Tip for Building Wealth Is a ‘Very Easy One’</a></strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Relocating To Florida Can Come With Unpleasant Financial Surprises</h2>\n<p>It’s not just costly home insurance and property taxes that potential Florida homebuyers need to be aware of.</p>\n<p>“One of the biggest surprises, especially for folks looking to buy near the beach or in older high-rise condominiums, is the Structural Integrity Reserve Study (SIRS) requirement,” Silva said. “After the tragic Champlain Towers collapse, Florida has cracked down on how condos maintain reserves for structural repairs. Now, homeowners are suddenly being hit with massive special assessments or monthly increases to catch up.”</p>\n<p>These extra payments are often unanticipated.</p>\n<p>“These fees vary widely, but they’re often significant and can come with little warning,” Silva said. “Without a well-informed team guiding you, what looks like a dream condo can quickly become a financial and emotional burden, simply because the true cost of ownership was buried in deferred maintenance.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Never Make a Financial Decision Based on Trends</h2>\n<p>High-net-worth Americans shouldn’t assume <a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/real-estate/florida-cities-people-are-moving-to/?hyperlink_type=manual&amp;utm_term=incontent_link_5&amp;utm_campaign=1304586&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_content=7&amp;utm_medium=rss\">moving to Florida</a> is a good decision just because other people in their income bracket are doing it.</p>\n<p>“Wealthy individuals didn’t build their success by following the herd,” Silva said. “But right now, I’m seeing a lot of families make emotional or reactive decisions — whether it’s relocating for a tax break, buying in trendy ZIP codes or moving assets based on headlines.”</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/financial-planning/most-important-financial-decisions-you-make-in-life/?hyperlink_type=manual&amp;utm_term=incontent_link_6&amp;utm_campaign=1304586&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_content=8&amp;utm_medium=rss\">best financial decision</a> for you is always the one that makes sense for your individual circumstances.</p>\n<p>“What I remind my clients is this — just because a move is popular doesn’t mean it’s right for you,” Silva said. “You need a personal strategy, not a crowd mentality. A move like this is more than a tax decision — it impacts your estate plan, asset protection, real estate exposure, cost of living and even how your legacy plays out.”</p>\n<p>Before making any big moves, Silva recommended seeking the advice of a professional.</p>\n<p>“That’s exactly where a skilled wealth advisor makes a difference,” he said. “We help families go beyond surface-level planning and build a strategy designed around their life, values and long-term goals.”</p>\n<p><strong>More From GOBankingRates</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"morefromgbr wp-block-list\">\n <li><a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com/saving-money/car/types-vehicles-retirees-stay-away-from-buying/?hyperlink_type=manual&amp;utm_term=morefrom_link_1&amp;utm_campaign=1304586&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_content=9&amp;utm_medium=rss\"><strong>5 Types of Vehicles Retirees Should Stay Away From Buying</strong></a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com/retirement/planning/how-far-750k-plus-social-security-goes-in-retirement-in-every-us-region/?hyperlink_type=manual&amp;utm_term=incontent_link_7&amp;utm_campaign=1304586&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_content=10&amp;utm_medium=rss\">How Far $750K Plus Social Security Goes in Retirement in Every US Region</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com/retirement/planning/4-things-you-should-do-if-you-want-to-retire-early/?hyperlink_type=manual&amp;utm_term=morefrom_link_2&amp;utm_campaign=1304586&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_content=11&amp;utm_medium=rss\"><strong>4 Things You Should Do if You Want To Retire Early</strong></a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com/saving-money/car/suvs-with-most-reliable-engines/?hyperlink_type=manual&amp;utm_term=incontent_link_8&amp;utm_campaign=1304586&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_content=12&amp;utm_medium=rss\">12 SUVs With the Most Reliable Engines</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n <li>Henry Silva, <a href=\"https://apollonwealthmanagement.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Apollon Wealth Management</a></li> \n</ul>\n<p>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com?utm_term=bottom_link&amp;utm_campaign=1304586&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_content=13&amp;utm_medium=rss\" target=\"_blank\">GOBankingRates.com</a>: <a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/wealth/financial-advisor-wealthy-americans-are-flocking-to-florida-but-they-shouldnt-be/?utm_term=source_link&amp;utm_campaign=1304586&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_content=14&amp;utm_medium=rss\" target=\"_blank\">Financial Advisor: Wealthy Americans Are Flocking To Florida, but They Shouldn’t Be</a></p>",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other technology stocks.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Technology stocks have faced heightened volatility in 2025, with market sentiment swinging sharply in response to President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies. On April 3, tech shares endured their worst day since the COVID-19 pandemic as Trump announced sweeping tariffs on all imported goods, including a 34% duty on Chinese imports, exacerbating fears of a global trade war. An iPhone maker led the steep declines among the \"Magnificent Seven,\" plummeting over 9% due to its reliance on Chinese manufacturing. Other tech giants also fell between 8% and 9%, while semiconductor and PC companies recorded double-digit losses. The tech-heavy NASDAQ tumbled 6%, marking its worst session over five years and deepening its year-to-date loss to more than 14%.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Despite the recent turmoil, broader optimism about technology and growth stocks remains underpinned by longer-term trends. Notably, Ken Fisher of <a href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/fisher-asset-management/11/\">Fisher Asset Management</a> has emphasized that while mega-cap tech firms often face headwinds, they tend to outperform during bullish cycles and reflect broader market confidence. He argues that 2024’s rally was more expansive than many recognize, with tech and communication services stocks leading growth across the board. While tech stocks often decline more in bearish periods, their historical track record of resilience and growth during recoveries continues to make them attractive for long-term investors. This underscores why, even amid significant volatility, tech stocks retain strategic value for portfolios, particularly when the market regains momentum.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Signs of a potential rebound appeared later in April, as major indexes recovered modestly on April 24, with tech shares helping lead the rally. Investors responded positively to reports that the U.S. and China had resumed trade talks, despite earlier denials from Beijing. Trump’s announcement that some tariffs might be rolled back helped ease immediate fears, although uncertainty remains high. Analysts noted that the recent tech selloff had left the market oversold, setting the stage for short-term gains. However, mixed earnings reports and rising costs across industries continue to fuel caution, reinforcing the unpredictable nature of trade policy’s impact on tech and broader equity markets.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify;\">Our Methodology</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">For this article, we scanned Fisher Asset Management’s Q4 2024 13F filings to identify billionaire Ken Fisher's technology stock picks with the highest upside potential. We compiled the tech equities with upside potential higher than 27% at the time of writing this article and discussed why they stood out as sound potential investments. Finally, we ranked the stocks based on the ascending order of their upside potential. To assist readers with more context, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock using data from 1,009 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 363.5% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 208 percentage points (<strong><a href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly\">see more details here</a></strong>).</p> \n<img alt=\"Is Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO\">AVGO</a>)</strong></h3> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong><em>Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 161</em></strong></p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong><em>Fisher Asset Management’s Equity Stake: $5.54 Billion&nbsp;</em></strong></p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong><em>Upside Potential as of April 30: 27.90%</em></strong></p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading American multinational technology company that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Its diverse product portfolio supports critical industries such as data centers, networking, wireless, broadband, storage, industrial systems, and enterprise software. The company plays a vital role in enabling high-performance connectivity and computing, particularly in the rapidly growing artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud infrastructure sectors.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered record-breaking financial results, with consolidated revenue reaching $14.9 billion—an increase of 25% year-over-year. This growth was fueled by a surge in demand for AI semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. AI-related revenue alone climbed 77% year-over-year to $4.1 billion, while infrastructure software revenue rose 47% to $6.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA also hit a new high of $10.1 billion, representing a 41% increase from the prior year. The company reported free cash flow of $6.0 billion, up 28% year-over-year, underscoring its strong cash generation capabilities. Broadcom ended the quarter with $9.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and returned significant capital to shareholders with a $2.774 billion dividend payout on December 31, 2024.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">For the future, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) projects continued momentum into the second quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by robust investment from hyperscale partners in AI data center infrastructure. The company anticipates second-quarter revenue to remain steady at approximately $14.9 billion, with adjusted EBITDA expected to account for around 66% of that revenue. CEO Hock Tan emphasized the sustained demand for AI XPUs and high-speed connectivity solutions, reinforcing Broadcom’s strategic positioning in the evolving AI-driven technology landscape.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Investor confidence in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to grow, with institutional interest in the stock surging. As of Q4 2024, Fisher Asset Management held approximately 24 million shares of the company, valued at over $5.5 billion. Hedge fund interest in Broadcom has also increased, with 161 funds tracked by Insider Monkey holding stakes worth over $22.2 billion by the end of the fourth quarter, up from 128 funds in Q3.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Mar Vista U.S. Quality Select Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q1 2025 <a href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/should-you-maintain-a-positive-outlook-on-broadcom-avgo-1515574/\">investor letter</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p style=\"text-align:justify;\">“We maintain a positive outlook on&nbsp;<strong>Broadcom Inc.</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:AVGO) shares, despite recent stock price pressure stemming from two key concerns: (1) uncertainty around potential tariffs and the impact on global growth, and (2) investor skepticism regarding the return profile of large-scale AI capex investments by hyperscalers. This skepticism has been amplified by the efficiency gains recently demonstrated by DeepSeek, an unknown Chinese software company, which developed a competitive large language model at a much lower cost. These efficiency gains stoked fears that hyperscalers may have overbuilt AI infrastructure.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Broadcom maintains a strong competitive position in the custom AI ASIC market, as well as a disciplined capital allocation, most recently reflected in the VMWare acquisition. That deal is already delivering better than-expected top-line growth and margin expansion. Broadcom is the leading provider of custom AI ASICs and has been steadily diversifying its customer base beyond its initial anchor client, Alphabet. Many hyperscalers are interested in developing custom ASICs, which are tailored to specific computing tasks, given their lower costs and attractive performance attributes relative to general-purpose GPUs from providers like NVIDIA.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align:justify;\">While we remain constructive on Broadcom’s long-term prospects, we did trim our position earlier in the quarter at higher levels to reallocate capital toward a more favorable risk-reward opportunity. Nonetheless, Broadcom remains a core holding in our portfolio and offers an attractive margin of safety. We believe the company is well-positioned to grow intrinsic value by +20% over the intermediate term.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Overall AVGO <strong>ranks 10th</strong> among billionaire Ken Fisher’s technology stock picks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

And the answer appears to be, with so much of Wall Street’s institutional money staying on the sidelines, bullish individual investors are driving the gains. History says there’s little sense in fighting this enthusiasm. To paraphrase the famous statement from former Citigroup CEO Chuck Prince in 2007 right before the global financial crisis hit, for now the music is still playing, so you have to dance.</p>\n<p>“There are so many smart people in our industry that just don’t get the simplicity of how this market works over longer periods of time, and I think it actually creates an opportunity,” said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC. “Am I siding with the retail investors here right now? I might be.”</p>\n<p>The fundamentals behind the enthusiasm, however, are less than promising.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Economic data has been uneven, as the impact of Trump’s sweeping tariffs is only starting to hit. This week, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that inflation-adjusted gross domestic product contracted in the first quarter for the first time since 2022, while figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that jobs growth was robust in April, although the labor market is showing signs of cooling. And the so-called soft data, which measures how consumers and households are feeling, also has been concerning.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Earnings have been solid, but far from great. For the most part, companies are reluctant to give hard outlooks for the rest of the year with so much uncertainty in the global economy. Big tech stalwarts Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. put up strong numbers this week, but Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. indicated that trade pressures are starting to hit. And although the Trump administration has talked about upcoming tariff agreements with some trade partners, the reality is nothing has happened and any concrete deals with terms nailed down are a ways off.</p>\n<p>‘New And Crazy’</p>\n<p>“I think every day stays new and crazy until we start seeing if the soft data leaks into the hard data,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company. “Absent that, I think you continue to trade off of the back and forth of what’s happening on the trade negotiation front, which I think is going to be ever-present in the future.”</p>\n<p>It’s a view that’s starting to catch on. Earlier this week, the trading desk at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said it had turned tactically bullish on US equities on expectations that low positioning and light volume following the early April rout, as well as optimism that Trump will soon announce something involving progress in trade talks, are catalysts for more upside in the S&amp;P 500. However, the bank added that this momentum could fade quickly once tariffs begin to drag on the economy.</p>\n<p>“Overall, the de-escalation trade has room to run,” head of global market intelligence Andrew Tyler told clients, while stressing that “this is not an all clear for markets.”</p>\n<p>The latest rebound is largely being driven by the same retail trading cohort that has bought the dips in most of the recent bull markets. Mom-and-pop investors snapped up $40 billion worth of US equities in April, a record for monthly inflows, according to Emma Wu, a global equity derivatives strategist at JPMorgan. And individual clients at Bank of America Corp. have been buyers for 19 consecutive weeks, the longest streak to start a year in the firm’s data going back to 2008.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the sentiment among institutional investors has only slightly improved, shifting from significantly underweight US stocks to neutral, according to data from Deutsche Bank AG. It’s unlikely the group will move to overweight stocks without concrete signs that Trump is backpedaling on his trade policies, the bank added.</p>\n<p>“We were pulling back from markets starting late last year, so we have some dry powder,” said Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments LLC, “But we’re scratching our heads right now at how the market can make a bottom before things are clear.”</p>\n<p>Need Clarity</p>\n<p>Indeed, clarity is what’s most lacking at the moment. Many companies, like American Airlines Group Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc., have abandoned earnings outlooks for the year because the economic backdrop is just too uncertain. Meanwhile, Amazon.com gave a weaker-than-expected forecast for operating income and said it’s bracing for a tougher business climate in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, the earnings guidance from Corporate America is the worst since the pandemic, according to Bloomberg Intelligence chief equity strategist Gina Martin Adams.</p>\n<p>“You don’t know who the winners and losers are going to be, yet you’ve got some idea about who might navigate things better or worse,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management. “The opportunity for getting whipsawed is just so much higher because of the uncertainty. It’s an unintended side effect of really whatever the Trump administration is trying to do.”</p>\n<p>Things are also sketchy on the tariff front, where the real tensions are with China. Chinese state media said the Trump administration has reached out to initiate talks, but it appears the US president’s tough stance has only strengthened China’s resolve to fight. For now, Chinese officials say they are assessing the possibility of trade talks with the US.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Trump administration says it’s close to some kind of resolution with India, Japan and South Korea. But even if an agreement in principle is reached, it will likely take months or years to hammer out the final terms of a deal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The markets have moved on comments from Trump and his administration, hopeful the tariff mess will just go away,” said Thomas Thornton, founder of Hedge Fund Telemetry LLC. “Trade deals historically take a lot of time, and in a world when we can order something on Amazon and get it the next day, people have unrealistic expectations.”</p>\n<p>For anyone looking ahead rather than responding in the moment, the soft economic data indicating that a slowdown is coming may be most troubling. US consumer sentiment is among the lowest going back to the 1970s, and long-term inflation expectations are the highest since 1981, both because of fears of the tariff fallout, according to the latest University of Michigan survey.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The soft data that has been envisioning a sharp economic downturn I think is going to quickly turn into hard data,” said Kathryn Rooney Vera, chief market strategist at StoneX Group. “Even if we get a trade agreement, I think volatility affects sentiment, consumption and investment.”</p>\n<p>--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke, Katrina Compoli, Reade Pickert and Matt Turner.</p>\n<p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/made-in-usa-wheelbarrows-promoted-by-trump-are-now-made-in-china?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Made-in-USA Wheelbarrows Promoted by Trump Are Now Made in China</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-02/how-an-israeli-hostage-negotiator-outsmarts-ransomware-hackers?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">How an Israeli Hostage Negotiator Outsmarts Ransomware Hackers</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-01/100-wild-moments-from-trump-s-first-100-days-you-probably-missed?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">100 Moments You Might Have Missed&nbsp;From Trump’s First 100 Days</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-01/can-the-labubu-doll-craze-survive-trump-s-tariffs?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Can the Labubu Doll Craze Survive Trump’s Tariffs?</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/healthy-sodas-like-poppi-olipop-are-drawing-pepsi-and-coca-cola-s-attention?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Healthy Sodas Like Poppi, Olipop Are Drawing PepsiCo’s and Coca-Cola’s Attention</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>©2025 Bloomberg L.P.</p>",

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other technology stocks.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Technology stocks have faced heightened volatility in 2025, with market sentiment swinging sharply in response to President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies. On April 3, tech shares endured their worst day since the COVID-19 pandemic as Trump announced sweeping tariffs on all imported goods, including a 34% duty on Chinese imports, exacerbating fears of a global trade war. An iPhone maker led the steep declines among the \"Magnificent Seven,\" plummeting over 9% due to its reliance on Chinese manufacturing. Other tech giants also fell between 8% and 9%, while semiconductor and PC companies recorded double-digit losses. The tech-heavy NASDAQ tumbled 6%, marking its worst session over five years and deepening its year-to-date loss to more than 14%.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Despite the recent turmoil, broader optimism about technology and growth stocks remains underpinned by longer-term trends. Notably, Ken Fisher of <a href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/fisher-asset-management/11/\">Fisher Asset Management</a> has emphasized that while mega-cap tech firms often face headwinds, they tend to outperform during bullish cycles and reflect broader market confidence. He argues that 2024’s rally was more expansive than many recognize, with tech and communication services stocks leading growth across the board. While tech stocks often decline more in bearish periods, their historical track record of resilience and growth during recoveries continues to make them attractive for long-term investors. This underscores why, even amid significant volatility, tech stocks retain strategic value for portfolios, particularly when the market regains momentum.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Signs of a potential rebound appeared later in April, as major indexes recovered modestly on April 24, with tech shares helping lead the rally. Investors responded positively to reports that the U.S. and China had resumed trade talks, despite earlier denials from Beijing. Trump’s announcement that some tariffs might be rolled back helped ease immediate fears, although uncertainty remains high. Analysts noted that the recent tech selloff had left the market oversold, setting the stage for short-term gains. However, mixed earnings reports and rising costs across industries continue to fuel caution, reinforcing the unpredictable nature of trade policy’s impact on tech and broader equity markets.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify;\">Our Methodology</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">For this article, we scanned Fisher Asset Management’s Q4 2024 13F filings to identify billionaire Ken Fisher's technology stock picks with the highest upside potential. We compiled the tech equities with upside potential higher than 27% at the time of writing this article and discussed why they stood out as sound potential investments. Finally, we ranked the stocks based on the ascending order of their upside potential. To assist readers with more context, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock using data from 1,009 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 363.5% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 208 percentage points (<strong><a href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly\">see more details here</a></strong>).</p> \n<img alt=\"Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best NASDAQ Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1195719\" height=\"816\" src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7ne4ita.670OYZ8yacfAww--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/226ed9ed0936942adb97f3d56073e411\" width=\"1456\" data-uuid=\"73a2b395-537b-3b23-9229-11e778fcc121\"> A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. \n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN\">AMZN</a>)</strong></h3> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong><em>Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 339</em></strong></p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong><em>Fisher Asset Management’s Equity Stake: $9.91 Billion&nbsp;</em></strong></p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong><em>Upside Potential as of April 30: 30.92%</em></strong></p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered robust financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, continuing the momentum it built in 2024 despite a challenging macroeconomic environment shaped by renewed U.S. trade tariffs. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.59, significantly surpassing analyst expectations of $1.36, and marking a notable increase from $0.98 per share in the same quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter reached $155.67 billion, slightly ahead of the $155 billion analysts had forecast, and up from $143 billion year-over-year. Amazon’s advertising business was a standout performer, growing 19% in Q1 2025 and exceeding analyst projections, further underscoring the company’s strength in high-margin, scalable business segments.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This performance marks the third consecutive quarter that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has exceeded analyst expectations. CEO Andy Jassy expressed optimism, stating, “We’re pleased with the start to 2025, especially our pace of innovation and progress in continuing to improve customer experiences.” These figures reflect Amazon’s continued operational discipline and leadership across its core businesses, including e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital advertising.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In alignment with its long-term growth strategy, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is making an aggressive push into artificial intelligence. The company has outlined plans to allocate approximately $100 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, with a significant portion directed toward expanding its AI infrastructure. Amazon executives have stated that as AI inference costs decline, the company will accelerate investments in both its cloud and retail AI capabilities.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Investor sentiment toward Amazon remains strong. Fisher Asset Management, for instance, held 45.16 million shares valued at $9.91 billion by the end of Q4 2024. Broader institutional interest has also increased, with 339 hedge funds reporting stakes in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), up from 286 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these positions has reached nearly $69.04 billion, highlighting enduring confidence in Amazon’s long-term potential, particularly in AI-driven innovation and logistics efficiency. With an upside potential of 30.92%, Amazon is among Ken Fisher’s technology stock picks with huge upside potential.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q1 2025 <a href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/what-makes-amazon-com-amzn-a-fundamentally-strong-company-1509317/\">investor letter</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>“Amazon.com, Inc.</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company renowned for its expansive e-commerce platform, offering a vast array of products and services to consumers worldwide. Beyond online retail, Amazon generates revenue through its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides scalable computing solutions to businesses and governments; subscription services like Amazon Prime, offering members benefits such as streaming content and expedited shipping; and advertising services that enable brands to reach targeted audiences on its platform. During the quarter, shares detracted from performance due to concerns surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump’s impending tariffs on imported goods, raising fears about increased operational costs and weaker consumer spending. Additionally, management’s lower-than expected fiscal first-quarter sales forecast and substantial planned investments—including a $100 billion commitment to AWS and AI infrastructure in 2025—further pressured sentiment regarding near term profitability. Despite the near-term share price weakness, we believe Amazon’s fundamentals remain strong given its diversified business model, continuous innovation, and dominant positions in high-growth areas like e-commerce and cloud computing.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Overall AMZN <strong>ranks 9th</strong> among billionaire Ken Fisher’s technology stock picks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.
